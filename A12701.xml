            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18269:3"/> particular anſwere, but alſo (though vrged as your Honour knoweth to frame vnto it a ſpeciall &amp; direct anſwere) I could yet hardly be brought to thinke it neceſſary (ſo baſely I eſteemed of it) to aford it any other anſwere, then either a fewe marginal notes that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I firſt red it I beſtowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> point to point, as it were in a table to haue ſhewed the reader, where and by whom he might read the ſame thing long ago, &amp; often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected on the one ſide, &amp; anſwered by the other, which might haue bene in one ſheet of paper ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well diſpatched. Howbeit in the end calling to minde what your Lordſhip tolde me, concerning the opinion that our poore ſeduced cuntrimen ſeeme ſecretly to haue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of it, as you learned by one of their owne ſpeeches had thereof vnto your ſelfe in acquainting you firſt with the booke, and marking how not onely by publiſhing it in engliſh, but alſo by entitling it both in the forhead, &amp; ouer euery leafe a notable diſcourſe againſt hereſies, they themſelues haue plainely ſhewed that they haue it in no baſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, &amp; finding it alſo ſince to be the iudgement of a certaine learned man of auncient and long experience euen of our owne ſide, now this laſt yeare publiſhed in print, that the hauing of this very booke ſo long in ſecret amongſt them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered,
<pb facs="tcp:18269:3"/> hath bene one great cauſe of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy of ſo many yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as of late yeares in this our cuntry haue reuolted from the truth to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: at the laſt I reſolued with my ſelfe, (though I know that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had done what I could herein, that I ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue ſaid litle or nothing not ſaid &amp; writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwel before by ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſide) that yet your Lordſhips requeſt made vnto me to anſwere it, as fully and directly as I coulde, when you firſt ſhewed me the booke &amp; how you came by it, was &amp; is ſuch, as that (both of duty to your ſelfe particularly for ſundry cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; to the church of Chriſt generally, for that by this means many may ſee togither an anſwere to that, which otherwiſe in great part either they might chance neuer to hit of in any other wryter of ours, or elſe be driuen to ſearch more, &amp; thoſe further then it was likely they would or could) I was bound to ſatisfy in as good ſort as any way conueniently I could. Hauing therefore encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radgement by theſe reaſons to take it in hand, &amp; hauing now by Gods grace finiſhed it in maner as you ſee, I preſent the ſame vnto your Honour as an vndoubted token of my dutifull affection towards you, beſeeching you not onely to take the paynes as your leaſure ſerueth you to peruſe it ouer your ſelfe, but alſo deſyring you
<pb facs="tcp:18269:4"/> to bee vnto it ſuch a patrone, as that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroade thus by your prouocation, it may haue your beſt protection and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, to paſſe vp and downe openly and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both in the veiw of frendes and foes vnto it. There was prefixed before <hi>Jhon de Albines</hi> book, vvhich your honour deliuered me, a long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the reader, made as it ſhould ſeeme, by the publiſher thereof in engliſh, and there was annexed vnto it in the later ende an offer of a catholicke (as hee is there termed) to a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned proteſtant, conſiſting of two and twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds and ſix ſignes of falſe prophets, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, and ſchiſmatiques: the preface I haue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the anſwere thereunto I haue placed next vnto my aunſwere vnto <hi>Albines</hi> booke it ſelfe: ſomewhat alſo I haue annexed (that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of mine to his booke finiſhed) in the latter ende, to ſhewe the vanitie and childiſhneſſe of thoſe things, which the author hath vttered in the application of thoſe ſix ſignes to vs: but to that which hee hath written concerning thoſe two and twenty demaunds I haue ſaid nothing. And indeed, becauſe otherwiſe the booke was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en farre greater then I imagined at the firſt it woulde, I haue not at all inſerted that offer nor anie part thereof. The reaſon of my not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:18269:4"/> at all with thoſe two and twenty demaunds, and not troubling this my booke at all with anie part of that offer, is, that Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe hath aunſwered thoſe demaundes, and that alſo nowe of late Maſter <hi>Crowley</hi> hath at large aunſwered, both them and that which is added concerning thoſe ſignes. Doctor <hi>Fulkes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thereunto maie bee had vnder the title of an aunſwere of a Chriſtian proteſtant, to the proude Chalenge of a popiſh Catholicke, and it is prefixed commonly before his booke writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in confutation of <hi>Allens</hi> of Purgatorie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede concerning the ſix ſignes hee ſaieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not becauſe of any greater matter in them then in the reſt, but becauſe at the firſt they were not publiſhed with the other: The demaunds though hee haue aunſwered ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to his manner, yet ſo ſharpely and effectuallie hee hath doone it, that, if the Chalenger were a man of his worde, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not long after a popiſh Catholicke. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Crowleys</hi> aunſwere to the whole offer worde for worde, as it was annexed to <hi>John de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> booke, is extant vnder the tytle of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate aunſwere to a raſh offer &amp;c. and it vvas printed by <hi>Iohn Charlewoode</hi> in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don 1588. They both haue vvith their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb facs="tcp:18269:5"/> ſet downe the words of the offerer. The trauels of theſe two men haue eaſed both me &amp; this booke of mine of medling any further then I haue ſayed with that Chalenger: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe ſince hee had his firſt aunſwere, we neuer yet heard that hee had either skill or will to replie. I might well ynough, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the largeneſſe and ſufficiency of Maſter <hi>Crowleys</hi> anſwere thereunto, haue omitted that vvhich I further haue ſayed to aunſwere his ſix ſignes not touched by Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> but that vvhat I haue vvritten thereabout vvas written before I ſawe Maſter <hi>Crowleys</hi> anſwere, and that I thought it not amiſſe to let it ſtande, that ſo betvvixt vs three the vvhole thus might bee tvvyſe aunſwered. Though it were Maſter <hi>Crowley</hi> (vvho as I noted before) in the firſt leafe of his booke making aunſwere to this offer, that gaue that iudgement that <hi>Iohn de Albines</hi> booke had beene the cauſe of ſo much apoſtaſy of late here amongſt vs, yet he, as he there ſhows, would not beſtowe tyme in aunſwering of it, becauſe ſuppoſing by the title it was written by a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; therefore either in french or latine, he thought that either <hi>Beza</hi> or ſome other french proteſtant had done it already ſufficiently. This when I redde firſt, it cauſed me to be the ſlacker
<pb facs="tcp:18269:5"/> both in finiſhing and publiſhing this anſwere of mine. Yet in the ende foraſmuch as this was now amongſt vs in Engliſh, and therefore in his opinion had hurt ſo much and ſo many Engliſh perſons, and I could neuer learne of any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that in any other language it had beene dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly anſwered by any: I thought it needefull and the beſt way (whether any ſuch anſwere in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue had beene made vnto it elſewhere or not) to preuent as much as maie bee anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch danger amongſt vs by it, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch poyſon with his fit counterpoyſon, that is, ſuch an Engliſh popiſh diſcourſe with an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh chriſtian anſwere. And the rather becauſe howſoeuer by the title there is ſhew that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was a Frenchman, yet indeede I can hardly be perſwaded that he was ſo. For his publiſher in Engliſh taking leaſure as he hath to trouble his reader with a long tedious and friuolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, hath not therein ſo much as ſecretly once inſinuated vnto vs, in what language the author wrote it, yea he hath not once me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned any tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of it, either by himſelfe or any other, the conſideration whereof together with ſundry phraſes and matters conteined in the booke, makes me rather thinke that ſome of our owne fugitiues, Engliſh Ieſuits, or ſeminary prieſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede

Thou Maior or head of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in any Citty or Towne, how haſt thou kept thy ſelfe cleere from periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? How haſt thou ſeene good order obſerued, and all idlenes and diſſolute maners to be baniſhed? Finally, thou, whatſoeuer officer or Magiſtrate thou be, how haſt thou regarded the common wealth, &amp; preferred it afore thy priuate lucre or commodity? O that theſe things were conſidered: for as ſure as God liueth, theſe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts will he call vpon ſtraightly. None ſhall eſcape, <hi>Cui multum datur</hi> (as <hi>S.

               <p>Now, good Reader, thou haſt hearde, that Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Bonus paſtor anima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dat pro ouibus ſuis,</hi> And to put thee out of doubt who is this good ſhepherde, he ſaieth: <hi>Ego ſum paſtor bonus, &amp; cognoſco oues meas, &amp; cognoſcunt me meae.</hi> I am the good ſhepherd, which will giue my life for my ſheepe, by my death to purchaſe them life, that as I will riſe, and die no more, ſo ſhall they after their bodily death ariſe at the laſt daie, neuer to die any more, but to liue alwaies with my father and me. I knowe my ſheepe, not al onely that they be mine, but I ſo know them for mine, that I will be their ſuccour in their tribulations, I will ſtrengthen them in their perſecutions, I will receaue them into my ioy and glory, I know them, and they know me. This is then required of their ſheepe, that they knowe their ſhepherde. Three properties muſt be in euery man or woman that ſhall haue this worthy name to be called a ſheepe of Chriſt.<note n="b" place="margin">Theſe being as indeede they are the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of chriſts ſheepe, thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it muſt needes followe, that he hath but fewe ſheepe in the popiſh flocke.</note> The firſt propertie is, that our Sauiour ſaieth, that his ſheepe doe know him.

Then by occaſion of this former need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſcourſe, hauing alleadged that <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. to proue that a good ſhepheard giueth his life for his ſheepe, and that Chriſt is that good ſheepheard that knowes his ſheepe, and is knowen of them, marke how in as many mo pages he inferreth, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the ſheepe know their ſhepheard, that they heare his voice, and geue no eare to the voice of a ſtranger, and laſtly, that they follow and obey their ſhepheard: which are things alſo (tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught and vnderſtoode) which we moſt gladly teach &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and for lacke of which properties of Chriſtes ſheepe wee conſtantly hold &amp; aduouch that the Romiſh flocke theſe manie yeares, hath rather beene a flocke of goates, then of Chriſtes true ſheepe. For if they knowe, as they ſhould, that the name of the ſheepheard Chriſt were the only name whereby commeth ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Act.</hi> 4. and that in him all things are prepared already. <hi>Math.</hi> 22. they would not ſet vp to themſelues ſo many names of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and thinges beſides him, nor hold that ſo many thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that are already prepared in him, are left to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and others to that ende to prepare, as they doe. And if they did ſo heare his voice, and refuſe to heare the voice of ſtrangers (as Chriſtes ſheepe ought) there neither would nor could be, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange doctrines, yea contrary doctrines to the voice of Chriſt ſet downe in the Canonical ſcriptures, receaued &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained amongſt them, as ear I haue done with <hi>Albine</hi> I ſhall ſhew there are.

Whither I haue iuſt ground and proofe for my thus ſaying, I referre thee to that which I haue written in confutation of <hi>Albines</hi> diſcourſe, cap. 4.17.29. &amp; 36. And yet ſuch is the folly of this nameles preface wryter, that hauing thus noted theſe, to be the properties of Chriſts true ſheepe, as though by and by without any further proofe at all, it ought of neceſsity to bee granted, that he and his ſide had all theſe properties, and that we of our ſide had neuer a one of them all, but were notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly branded with the contrary markes, he triumpheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth ouer vs, ſpending all the reſt of his preface in railing vpon vs, and in perſwading his reader to forſake vs, and to ioyne with him &amp; his. So that all the reſt of his preface is builded, vppon a moſt ſhamefull and impudent begging of all theſe points; that they know Chriſt aright, heare his voice &amp; no other, obey him and follow him moſt orderly: and alſo of theſe (that his begging of that former may ſeeme the more reaſonable) that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is ſound, hauing countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al auncient &amp; holy fathers, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of al Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Regions, &amp; preſcription of time, that their prelates are al prelates lawfully called, hauing right ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, &amp; euery thing that they ſhould haue, to credit them withal, &amp; therefore that they are ſuch, as Chriſt hath commaunded, to to be obeyed as himſelfe, and laſtly, that their church is the holie Catholike church, the obedient ſpouſe of Chriſt, and mother of all the faithfull, and that therefore it is damnation to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, or to refuſe to obey any of her lawes and ordinances, &amp; that with vs, all things are quite contrary. All theſe things his reader muſt graunt him &amp; ſuppoſe to be true, for he hath nothing at all to proue any one of theſe, beſides ſwelling words of vanity, and lofty arrogant bragging that theſe things are ſo. And therefore al theſe things, being the things in queſtion betwixt vs, and ſuch, as we all, moſt conſtantly and iuſtly haue alwaies denied, (as our writings of theſe points heretofore, &amp; now this anſwere of mine in ſundry places thereof, make manifeſt to any indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reader) thereupon it muſt needes follow, that whatſoeuer he hath allead<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, either out of ſcripture or doctor to perſwade his reader to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their church, their prelates, their ordinances &amp; traditions, is ſhamefully abuſed. For compare the times when, &amp; the perſons whereof thoſe things were written, their doctrine and doings with theſe, and you ſhall finde, (witnes the ſcriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:18269:17"/> and all ſound antiquity) as much differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt their church prelates, doctrine and ordinances, and them of whom thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be truely vnderſtoode, as there is betwixt light and darkeneſſe, the pure Church of Chriſt, and the impure Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Antichriſt. And alſo, all his exhortation vpon theſe grounds, to ioine with them, and all his bitter inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, for refuſing ſo to doe, is as a building in the aire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all foundation. And therefore is thus eaſilye pulde downe, and laide vnderfoote, as a thing more meete to bee trampled vpon, as a thing of nothing, then by any to bee at all regarded. And yet as foule a fault as this is in him, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with all wryters of his ſide, and moſt notoriouſly with this <hi>Iohn de Albine,</hi> before whoſe booke, hee hath ſet this his preface. It may bee, ſeeing his author, whom hee ment to publiſh, and of whom he had ſuch an opinion, that hee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a notable diſcourſer againſt hereſies, to haue ſuch a grace and dexterity, in ſtuffing out his booke almoſt with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but with this beggerly begging the maine queſtions alwaies, that he thought his preface ſhould not be ſuteable, and fit to be ſet before ſuch a learned diſcourſe, vnleſſe it were garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; bewtified with the ſame popiſh grace. And if this were his reaſon (then which I am ſure hee hath no better) hee is to bee borne withall, for what reaſon is there to the contrary, but that according to the rules of decency, the preface and the booke whereunto it is a preface ſhall be conformable one to the other.</p>
               <p>And yet though this be the very methode and matter (good Reader) of all this his long tedious preface, which I thus brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie haue laide open before thee, the poore ſilly man the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof, ſeemeth to haue conceiued ſuch a liking of his owne doings therein, eſpecially towards the latter ende thereof, that gloriouſly and triumphantly hee breaketh out into wonderful complaints, amplifications, and exclamations againſt vs. Alas poore man that hee was, thought hee to meete with no reader, but that would graunt him all theſe thinges at the firſt asking? Or thought hee that hee had ſo cunningly and artificially knit thoſe things together, that no man could eſpy the childiſh loſenes of them? From his firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall farre ſet and yet vnneceſſary diſcourſe of the duety of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb facs="tcp:18269:17"/> hee ſo ſuddenly falleth into the next, of the properties of Chriſtes ſheepe, that it was great maruaile that the man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as thoſe things ſufficiently conuince the man and his preface of groſſe folly and vanitie, ſo if we conſider, but howe he hath wilfully ſought to abuſe his reader, in cyting the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and others, to perſuade his reader by his authoritie, to obey their prelates and traditions, we ſhall as plainely finde in the man palpable impiety. For page ſecond, he cyteth his fourth booke and forty three chapter, to proue vnto vs nowe, that wee muſt obey their Church, now ſpeaking vnto vs by their prelates, becauſe then <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tolde the heretiques a thouſand and foure hundred yeares agoe and more (whom indeede the paſtours of the Church that then was, continued ſoundly in the purity of the Apoſtolique doctrine) that they were to obey the paſtours of the Church that had ſucceſsion from the Apoſtles. Which any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſee, bindeth not, nor teacheth vs to do the like to theirs, vnleſſe they could proue theirs to be ſuch, as there <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of. Likewiſe whatſoeuer elſe in this preface of his to like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he hath alleadged out of <hi>Irenaeus, Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Hierome,</hi> or the ſcriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, is abuſed, for that which they ſpake of that pure &amp; true Church of Chriſt, and her faithfull miniſters, that he would drawe his reader to think to be ſpoken, euen of the Church of Rome as it is now, and hath beene of late yeares, and of her prelates, which are in nothing almoſt, like either the Church or miniſters that they ſpeake of. But this is not all his fault in alleadging this teſtimonie of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> thus to confounde the prelates and Church with the true paſtours of Chriſt and his pure Church, a thouſande fower hundreth yeares agoe, whereunto theirs are no more like then darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to light, but that alſo wilfully (the eaſilier belike to beguyle the ſimple reader) hee concealeth that, that

Wherein eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently it appeareth, he left out the former words (ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in the author in the midſt betwixt the former part of the ſentence, and the latter here alleadged by him) to make the reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Irenaeus minde was, to teach men ſimply to obey ſuch prelates, without exception, as haue ordinarie, outward, and locall ſucceſsion downe from the Apoſtles, and that that kinde of ſucceſsion in place and office, is the principall ſucceſsion that he ſpeaketh of, which who ſo hath not, ought by and by to bee ſuſpected of hereſy. But indeede take al his words together and marke them, (eſpecially thoſe which craftily he had gelded the ſentence of, in his quoting of them) and it is moſt cleare, that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus</hi> here teacheth obedience onely to ſuch Biſhops, as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Apoſtles, in the certaine gift of trueth, that by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſucceſsion, he ment nothing elſe but ſucceſſion to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in that gift of trueth, and that therefore he would haue vs, to ſuſpect all thoſe to be heretiques, that lack ſucceſsion vnto them in that, howſoeuer and whereſoeuer they ſucceede them elſe. Which is the very cauſe, why according to this rule we think no better of their popiſh biſhops &amp; prieſts, then we do (what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer otherwiſe they bragge of) for that, ſure we are, that long ago they are gone from this principal ſucceſsion in trueth. This he knew euery one would perceiue, if he had faithfully cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Irenaeus wordes as they lye, and therefore hee thought beſt, to ſhew how he could followe the example of that olde fox Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who for his purpoſe in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, mangled the 91.

Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Biſhops of Rome, hauing had ſo little care to doe this great while, if this rule of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> may bee followed, they cannot poſsibly eſcape this ſuſpition. The credit therefore of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waying more with the writer of this preface then his owne, he thought it was better thus to leeſe his owne, by thus ſhamefully abuſing his reader in prouing this teſtimony after the popiſh manner, then once to hazard the credit of his holy fathers the popes, by right, faithfull, and honeſt dealing therewith. Howbeit, this kinde of dealing of his, may giue iuſt occaſion to all that are wiſe euer hereafter, to looke better to the fingers of all ſuch fellowes, then vpon their bare word to truſt them any more in their quoting or citing of the fathers. But leſt we ſhould thinke that this was but a ſlippe of his by chance, &amp; that hee was not his crafteſ-maſter in this kinde of dealing, he hath plaide vs the very like trick againe with this ſame father pa. 18. &amp; where he alleadgeth the fourth chapter of the ſaid <hi>Irenaeus</hi> third booke, to iuſtify their traditions not warranted by the written word. For in the beginning of the ſaide chapter not fiue lines before the wordes cited by him, hee ſpeaking of the ſcriptures written by the Apoſtles &amp; Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts, he ſaith, that they into that rich treaſury moſt fully haue brought all things that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to truth, ſo that euery one that will, may fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence take the drink of life. And that which he ſpeaketh in the words alleaged by him of following of tradition, it is ſpoken on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of ſuppoſition, to ſhew what courſe had bene beſt for the Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue ariſen, if they had not left vs ſcriptures. For his words are theſe: if the Apoſtles had not left vs ſcriptures, muſt we not haue followed the order of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they gaue to them to whom they committed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? In which caſe (which is not our caſe nowe, ſeeing they haue left vs ſcripture) we grant we ſhould haue beene, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of all controuerſies that could haue ariſen, ouerruled by that which they deliuered by word of mouth to ſuch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that being the caſe, no better or readier way for the ending
<pb facs="tcp:18269:19"/> of controuerſies, ſhould there haue been, then to haue recourſe to the moſt ancient Churches wherin they were conuerſant, and ſo by their tradition, to haue learned the certainty therein. But thus, by way of ſuppoſition, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaking of their tradition, in the caſe ſuppoſed by him, certaine it is, that by their tradition, he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth that ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d form of doctrin, which they deliuered by their preaching, &amp; teaching, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would &amp; ſhould haue been the ſame (foraſmuch as they ſpoke &amp; wrot by one ſpirit) that now they haue left vs in writing. And therefore eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the Romiſh Church, ſhould haue been as far to ſeeke, as ſhe is now, for hauing any warrant from thence, for thoſe things that ſhe holdeth, either contrary, or beſides the word written. And that by tradition, he meaneth here no other thing, it is euident, for in the firſt chapter of that booke he ſaith plainely: <hi>Quod tum praeconiauerunt, poſtea, per Dei voluntatem nobis tradiderunt in ſcripturis, columnam &amp; fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fidei futurum,</hi> that is, that which firſt they preached, after by the will of god, they deliuered vnto vs in the ſcriptures, to be the piller and ground of faith. And in the third chapter of that book (hauing before ſpoken of the Apoſtolicke tradition) he after ſheweth what he meant thereby, namely this, that god the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heauen and earth &amp;c, as he is deſcribed in the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Apoſtles haue taught to be the father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, contrary to the phantaſticall franticke dreame of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> ſo plainely ſhewing, that they that would, euen by the ſcriptures themſelues, might learne what the Apoſtolick traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was. Now what is this, for the authoriſhing, the vnwrite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Romiſh church, which are not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly al beſide the ſcriptures, but whereof the moſt are contrary thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to? But this, gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is the right trick of all the crue of theſe Romaniſts, thus by the ambiguity of words out of the fathers, to ſeek to colour their abſurd opinions, &amp; ſo er thou be a ware, to deceaue thee, if thou take not heede. As for example, to perſwade a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to like of their beggerly vnwritten traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whatſoeuer any father ſpeaketh of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it be neuer ſo plaine in the author himſelfe, that thereby he meaneth nothing leſſe, then ſuch traditions as theirs, yet that muſt be confidently brought in, as fit, &amp; moſt pregnant, for their purpoſe. Likwiſe whatſoeuer any father hath ſaid of any ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the outward elements, for that therein their name, vſe, &amp; eſtimation are cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, though the ſame father in a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other places ſhew, that his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, that there is no
<pb facs="tcp:18269:19"/> change at all there in ſubſtance, yet that muſt be quoted as a flat place for Popiſh tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation. And euen ſo, if they find in a father ſpeaking of the Euchariſt, any mention of a ſacrifice, as though there were no kind of ſacrifice, but that which they dream to bee there, that muſt be vrged as a ſtrong place, to proue their blaſphemous ſacrifice for the quick &amp; the dead. And this iugling with the fathers, and coſening of their poore ſimple readers, vſe they in al their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies. But at this time, thou muſt pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this preface writer this fault, becauſe herein, he doth but ſtudy to bee like him, before whoſe book he hath ſet this his preface. For chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fifth, he himſelfe moſt groſly committeth this ſame fault, in the detection whereof, I haue more at large diſcouered this lewde dealing of theirs. In the meane time, let vs not forget that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath taught vs, what that church is, who thoſe paſtours be, &amp; what thoſe traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are, that we muſt obey &amp; be ruled by, namely, onely that Church that hath the ſcriptures for the piller &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of her faith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. thoſe paſtours that ſucceede the Apoſtles in truth of doctrine, <hi>li.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. &amp; thoſe traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which haue good warrant from the ſcriptures themſelues, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. whereof it muſt needes follow, that all the places &amp; reaſons quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, either out of the ſcriptures or fathers, to binde vs to yeeld obedience to their churches ordinances, their prelates co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, &amp; to the points warranted onely by their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their Church hauing another foundation of her faith then the worde written, namely alwaies their popes will as it hath, &amp; the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their prelates, &amp; traditions, being not only beſide, but alſo often moſt groſly contrary to that word of God writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as I ſhal ſhew in ſundry places, er I haue done with <hi>Albine</hi>) in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ar but ſo many abuſings and corruptings of their holy &amp; good meanings. And yet thus, hauing to no purpoſe beſtowed a great deale of idle paines, as one that had ſaid inough to proue that the authority of all the learned fathers, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regions, &amp; preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time, were al ful &amp; faſt of his ſide, he luſtily braggeth <hi>p.</hi> 22. that if their be any weight in any, or al theſe together, that his ſide hath the true goſpell, &amp; the true ſence thereof. That their Religion is the very Chriſtian Religion, their order of ceremonies the right order, and that their faſting and praying, is according to the ſcriptures, and that therefore their church is the lawfull and true ſpouſe of Chriſt, from which, who ſo ſeperates himſelfe, is in ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb facs="tcp:18269:20"/> This thus only ſaid, thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by and by, as though there were no remedy, but that we muſt needs grant all this to be true, he taketh occaſion to triumph, and to frame a bitter inuectiue, againſt our Religion and liues: ſo concluding his wordy preface, with an exhortation to his Reader to forſake vs &amp; our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to ioine againe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theirs. All which becauſe it is nothing, but the vaine &amp; malitious wordes of a fooliſh aduerſary, without proofe or ſhadowe of proofe (which therefore I am ſure the wiſe Reader will make no reckoning of,) I might very well let paſſe with this onely anſwere, that whatſoeuer he hath here ſaid brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly, either in the commendation of his Religion &amp; Church, or to the diſgrace of ours, is vtterly falſe, and that I haue plentifully proued it ſo to be, in ſundry places of this my anſwere. Howbeit ſeing this is not only his brag, but the brag alſo a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of times, of <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> in the booke following, &amp; indeed, is in effect, the only thing, by taking whereof granted, moſt ſubtily they, &amp; all their fellowes, ſeeke to beguile their ſimple readers, it ſhal not be amiſſe, becauſe here firſt we meete with it, leaſt otherwiſe the Reader ſhould be too ready, to ſuffer his hart to be ſoreſtald with this falſe principle, to the preiudice of the truth, ſomewhat to ſay to make both the vanity &amp; falſhood hereof to appeare to euery one. Firſt therefore it is worthy the marking, that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though (as hee plainly ſheweth, hee had here a full purpoſe, at leaſt in wordes, to giue as great countenaunce as he could to his cauſe) that yet, he ſeekes to giue it credit, but by the teſtimonie of fathers, conſent of Chriſtian regions, and preſcription of time, in the meane time, omitting that which is to be preferd before all theſe, namely the teſtimony of the vndoubted word of God, reuealed &amp; ſet downe in the ſcriptures: wherein he hath dealt but as the nature of his cauſe requires, which hath no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from thence, and as the faſhion of other of his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this caſe is. For hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, that there is nothing more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in their diſcourſes then to labour by all meanes they can, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the written word of god, and to eſtabliſh the credite of a word vnwritten, which they count to be the traditions or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practiſe of the Church of Rome. To this ende they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe ſo much paines as they doe, at leaſt to make ſhewe of proofe, that the ſcriptures are ſo darke and obſcure, ſo inſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the direction of the Church in all matters, and of ſo vveake
<pb facs="tcp:18269:20"/> authority of themſelues without the authority and teſtimonie of the Church to countenance them, that without the foreſaid vnwritten word, no man could either fully or certainly, be ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the truth. So that herein this is their drift, that they indeed being without all ſounde warrant out of the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures, for thoſe thinges which wee count erroneous in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they yet may make their followers beleeue, that they haue as good ground as need be for them, in that they can proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the tradition of the Church, which they call the word of god vnwritten, and which they hold to be not onely aequal, vnto the other that is written, but alſo far more full and certaine for the determining the trueth of all controuerſies. And therefore <hi>Soto contra Brentium, Caniſius cap.</hi> 5. of his Catechiſme, and <hi>Lindan lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. of his panoplie are not aſhamed to confeſſe, (reckening almoſt all the pointes in controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and vs) that they haue their ground and warrant from tradition, not written in the ſcriptures. And hereupon it is, that there is nothing more common with any of them, then when wee preſſe them, with this, that the opinions for the which we ſtriue with them haue no warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the ſcripture, yea that the ſcriptures rightly vnderſtoode are flatte againſt them therein, to flye to tradition, which is the cauſe that this fellowe him ſelfe was ſo buſie before to abuſe <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> for the countenance of that onely foundation of their Religion. For this cauſe we may &amp; doe ſay of them, &amp; that iuſtly, by their owne confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaide of the hereticks in his time, they cannot ſtand, if they be driuen once to determine al their controuerſies by the ſcriptures, <hi>de Reſurrectione Carnis cap.</hi> 3. Now as for vs (Chriſtian reader) for all this lewde bragge of his, we appeale to theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of god, and onely wee allowe of them, as of a moſt perfect touchſtone whereby to trye, in all matters of Religion, the pure golde from the counterfait, crauing no further liking nor allowance in any thing, then by them wee are able ſoundly to proue, and confirme that which we ſay and teach. And the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient holy fathers, and ſo the Chriſtian regions in al ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of time, which are the things that he here brags of, as it appeares in all ſound monuments of antiquity, euer ſince theſe ſcriptures were written, for the determining of controuerſies in their times, haue alwaies taken this courſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute &amp; confound
<pb facs="tcp:18269:21"/> all aduerſaries to the truth. As for their owne authority, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any other before them, no further credit they craue, then as they are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to agree with theſe ſcriptures, otherwiſe the more that haue couſeted &amp; the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger they held, the worſe. This I haue made manifeſt by ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull teſtimony of the ancient fathers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues <hi>cap.</hi> 3.5.23. And therfore whiles he ſends vs thus to the fathers, Chriſtian regions conſent, &amp; preſcription of time, he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vs but about the buſh, for when we come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they will ſend vs backe againe to the ſcriptures. But whiles they take this courſe in ſeeking rather countenance for their cauſe any where elſe, then at, or by the canonicall ſcriptures, in the iuſt iudgement of god, they plainly bewray themſelues to euery ſimple ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue but a bad cauſe, that they ſo ſhun the light, and refuſe the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; moſt indifferent triall of it, which queſtionles is by theſe ſcriptures, whoſe neither authority nor indifferecy, without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, may once be called in queſtion. Indeed I read, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were preſſed with the authority of theſe ſcriptures, the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cionites</hi> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the defence of their hereſy, their paraclet or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forters viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: &amp; that likewiſe the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taniſts</hi> did fly to their prophecy: the <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinians</hi> to their dreams of their <hi>Aeons:</hi> the <hi>Manichees</hi> to their fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal Epiſtle: the <hi>Iewes</hi> to their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud:</hi> &amp; the <hi>Turks</hi> to their <hi>Alcaron:</hi> &amp; belike leſt theſe ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnlike theſe their predeceſſors, they will thus fly from the vndoubted authority of god, ſpeaking in the ſcriptures, to the vncertaine and variable authority of man.</p>
               <p>Yet if this were true that he ſaith, that they haue the auncient holy fathers, the common conſent of all Chriſtian regions, &amp; pre ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time of their ſide, it were ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ewhat, &amp; ſome likelihood it were, that things were with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he ſaith, I muſt needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, but indeed &amp; truth, they haue neither al nor any of theſe, in that ſort to ſpeake for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he would make his Reader beleeue. For firſt, there is plaine contrariety betwixt their doctrine, &amp; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the auncient holy fathers, in a number of moſt weighty points, as I haue ſhewed at large <hi>ca.</hi> 17. &amp; 29. likewiſe in that both ther, &amp; alſo <hi>c.</hi> 39. &amp; 40. in that I ſhew, that they hold many things directly contrary to the ancient generall councels, I plentifully proue, that they are deſtitute, of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſent of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regions.

               <p>Hereunto therefore, whereas the foreſaid offerer, and others of that ſide, ſo ſtand vpon the antiquity of their Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they would ſeeme we muſt needes grant, that they are even as auncient, as they pretend, vnles we can ſhew when, where, &amp; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a ſodaine change fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theirs was made, &amp; that ſome of our ſide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly eſpied it, &amp; withſtood it, vnreaſonable it is that they demaunde. For popery being not one, or two particular hereſies, nor ſuch a maſſe or heape of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, whoſe property is to burſt in all at once of the ſodaine, ſhewing it ſelfe with open and bare face at the firſt, but as it is tearmed, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. a miſtery of iniquity, and therefore a falſe Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, creeping in cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly by litle &amp; litle, as it were, by ſtealing ſteps, &amp; that hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſmuch as might bee, vnder the ſhew &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of holines through hypocriſy 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; Reu.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 11. no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though it were not only verie hard, but euen impoſsible, in
<pb facs="tcp:18269:22"/> euery reſpect to ſatisfie this demaunde. And yet for al this, were popery neuer a whit the more to be liked. For as we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that oſtentimes there is far more daunger in thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſteale vppon a man by little and little, and therefore are not reſiſted at the firſt, then in thoſe that are apparant and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent when they begin, and therefore then are they more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtoode and looked vnto: euen ſo oftentimes alſo it falles out in errours and hereſies, that they of al other in the end proue the moſt dangerous, whoſe beginnings haue beene moſt cloſe and ſecret, and whoſe growing to their perfection hath not been of the ſodaine, but in long tract of time. Indeede thoſe diſeaſes that come vpon the ſodaine and are violent, &amp; in their fulnes at the firſt, men at the firſt may eſpy and complaine of, but ſo it is not, not cannot be alwaies in the other. We ſee alſo, that though it be an eaſy matter to name the father of a lawfully begotten childe, yet no man commonly can tell who is the father of the baſe ſonne of a common woman. But to make it yet more cleare, that popery may be naught (as it is) &amp; yet this his demaunde be vnreaſonable, we are to cal to mind, that Chriſt our ſauiour, who knew beſt how ſuch moſt dangerous cankers and diſeaſes, would grow and come vp in his church, hath taught vs <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that it will not alwaies be knowen &amp; eſpied, no not of his owne houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde ſeruants, when and by whom firſt the tares are ſowen in his field, where he had before onely ſowed good ſeede. And there he ſhowes vs, that notwithſtanding, that it ſhall be ſufficient to proue them tares, in that afterwards whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are come vp, they differ as they doe from the good ſeed. Though therefore it were ſo, that we could not tel when, &amp; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, popery was firſt ſowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Gods field, yet in that now it being growen vp therein, as it is, it being compared with gods good ſeede taken out of the garner or barne of his holy written word, it differeth from it as it doth, that ought to be ſufficient proofe vnto vs, that it is but tares, &amp; of the deuils ſowing by his deuiliſh ſeedſime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whenſoeuer they did it.

Likely enough alſo is it, that the great credit that the ancient biſhops of Rome were in, for their piety and godlineſſe, and the lofty eſtate of their ſucceſſours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, ſo dazeled on the one ſide, the eyes of the godly in ancient time, that they were not curious, in reſiſting the doings of their ſucceſſours: and ſo bridled on the other ſide, the tongues of the worldly minded of theſe latter dayes, that they durſt not write that which they ſaw: all which reaſons layd together make it euident, that it ought to be no wonder, nor yet any argument, any whit at all to credit popery, though this offerers demaunde could not be ſatisfied.

But ſeeing for all this the Biſhops of Rome ſtill were too buſy, in meddling further then they ſhould, after this in the counſell of Nice cannon 6. their authority and the Patriarches of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria are made equall about the yeare 320. And yet the better to ſtay and keepe the Biſhops of Rome within their due limits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, in moſt counſels for 300. yeares after ſomething ſtill was done to bridle them. For certaine it is that as it appeares diſt. 99. the thirde counſell of Carthage helde about the yeare 435. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. forbad the ambitious and proud tytles of Prince, of Prieſts, High-prieſts &amp; ſuch like, euen to the Biſhops of the firſt ſee.

And the great generall councell of Calcedon held about the yeare 453. when the Biſhop of Romes legates had done what they could to the contrary <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16. &amp; canon 28. gaue the Patriarch of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople equal priuiledges with the Biſhop of Rome. And long after this, the firſt generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, being the third (as it is noted in the ſecond tome of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles) held at Conſtantinople in the time of <hi>Pope Agatho,</hi> about the yeare of the Lord 681. renuing a decree before there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, in a councell conſiſting of 150.

<pb facs="tcp:18269:24"/> the former fiue general councels, we ſhall finde them all to haue had a care by their decrees, to keepe the biſhops of Rome within their due bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of their owne patriarchall ſee. For proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but read the ſixt canon of the Nicene, the ſecond &amp; third of the firſt of Conſtantinople, the eight of the Epheſme, remembring withal the twenty eight of the Calcedon, twiſe now immediatly before mentioned, &amp; vnderſtand that the fift gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral councell ſolemnely confirmed thoſe fowre former, and their canons &amp; decrees, and he cannot chooſe but ſee this to be moſt manifeſt. But amongſt all the reſt, notable is that that appeares to this end in that great ſolemne Africane councel, where <hi>Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Boniface,</hi> &amp; <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> three popes on a rew, by their Legates vnder one of their hands alleadging a falſe canon of the councel of Nice, all that was determined in former councels to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſhewed themſelues intolerably ambitious of ſupremacy, thereby moſt egerly claiming ſuch a prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be giuen to their ſee, that if any biſhop or miniſter, were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any other prouince, or Patriarchal ſee, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his appeale to Rome, the Biſhop of Rome might accept thereof, &amp; therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either write his letters to the next prouince to determine the matter, or elſe to ſende his Legate from his ſide to repreſent his own perſon, to ſit in iudgement with the biſhops there to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter. For there, as it appeares, in the 101 102 103 &amp; 105 <hi>chap.</hi> of that councell, in the firſt tome of the councels, this their allegation was not onely examined, by all the copies of the Nicene councell that they had there, but alſo by ancient copies thereof, which they ſent for thither of purpoſe to Alexandria, Antioch, &amp; Conſtantinople, &amp; thereby in the open face of that councell, where 217 Biſhops were aſſembled, their forgery was eſpied, &amp; therefore that allegation notwithſtanding, the biſhop of Romes dealing concerning <hi>Apiarius</hi> (who then gaue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that ſtur) was there openly diſliked &amp; condemned, &amp; therefore to preuent the like thereafter, they in their 92 <hi>chapter</hi> there determine, that whoſoeuer ſhould ſo appeale any more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the biſhops, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels of Africke beyond the ſeas, ſhould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth neuer after of any in Africke be receaued into communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beſides, as it appears there in the 105. <hi>cap.</hi> by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of that councell, a letter was framed and ſent to <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end therof (as it ſhould ſeeme by the ſtories about
<pb facs="tcp:18269:25"/> the yeare foure hundred and thirty) wherein firſt they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him to admit no more ſuch appeales, or fugitiues, but to ſend them backe againe alwaies to their owne prouinces and Metropolitans, and the rather, ſay they, becauſe ſuch order was taken by the Nicene councell. And after therein they pleade the equity of that ordinance, becauſe the holy ghoſt is aſwell in one prouince, as in an other, and there the cauſe is alwayes like beſt to bee handled, where it doeth ariſe, becauſe of the neighneſſe of the vvitneſſes. Wherefore hauing tolde him, that they finde no ſuch thing in the truer copies of the Nicene councell, as <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> ſent by him alleadged, they flatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him the ſending of his agents or legates any more, vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch occaſion amongſt them.

But to leaue this matter, and to go on to others: becauſe the author of this preface, and brag that I novv am in aunſwering, in his brag maketh ſpeciall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you haue heard of their order of ceremonies, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of praying, and faſting, boſting that for theſe, they haue the holy fathers, the conſent of all chriſtian nations, and preſcription of long continuance, yea for the tvvo laſt the very ſcriptures: let vs firſt ſee if wee can finde out the originall, and vvithall the iuſt reproofe and condemnation of theſe. Firſt for their ceremonies, none that hath but redde <hi>Platina,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtory of the liues of their popes, but he hath red when, how, and by whom they were deuiſed, for there is few of them, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeares together, that thought, as it ſhould ſeeme by the vvriters of their liues, that they had worthily ſate in that place, vnles they had deuiſed ſome newe rite and ceremony more then was before.

               <p>Indeed faſting is a thing, and ſo is prayer, that hath counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſcriptures, fathers, Chriſtian regions, and of all ages and times, but ſo hath not either the popiſh faſting or praying.

And yet the better to ſtay and keepe the Biſhops of Rome within their due limits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, in moſt counſels for 300. yeares after ſomething ſtill was done to bridle them.

For proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but read the ſixt canon of the Nicene, the ſecond &amp; third of the firſt of Conſtantinople, the eight of the Epheſine, remembring withal the twenty eight of the Calcedon, twiſe now immediatly before mentioned, &amp; vnderſtand that the fift gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral councell ſolemnely confirmed thoſe fowre former, and their canons &amp; decrees, and he cannot chooſe but ſee this to be moſt manifeſt. But amongſt all the reſt, notable is that that appeares to this end in that great ſolemne Africane councel, where <hi>Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Boniface,</hi> &amp; <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> three popes on a rew, by their Legates vnder one of their hands alleadging a falſe canon of the councel of Nice, all that was determined in former councels to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſhewed themſelues intolerably ambitious of ſupremacy, thereby moſt egerly claiming ſuch a prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be giuen to their ſee, that if any biſhop or miniſter, were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any other prouince, or Patriarchal ſee, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his appeale to Rome, the Biſhop of Rome might accept thereof, &amp; therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either write his letters to the next prouince to determine the matter, or elſe to ſende his Legate from his ſide to repreſent his own perſon, to ſit in iudgement with the biſhops there to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter. For there, as it appeares, in the 101 102 103 &amp; 105 <hi>chap.</hi> of that councell, in the firſt tome of the councels, this their allegation was not onely examined, by all the copies of the Nicene councell that they had there, but alſo by ancient copies thereof, which they ſent for thither of purpoſe to Alexandria, Antioch, &amp; Conſtantinople, &amp; thereby in the open face of that councell, where 217 Biſhops were aſſembled, their forgery was eſpied, &amp; therefore that allegation notwithſtanding, the biſhop of Romes dealing concerning <hi>Apiarius</hi> (who then gaue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that ſtur) was there openly diſliked &amp; condemned, &amp; therefore to preuent the like thereafter, they in their 92 <hi>chapter</hi> there determine, that whoſoeuer ſhould ſo appeale any more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the biſhops, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels of Africke beyond the ſeas, ſhould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth neuer after of any in Africke be receaued into communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>Indeed faſting is a thing, and ſo is prayer, that hath counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſcriptures, fathers, Chriſtian regions, and of all ages and times, but ſo hath not either the popiſh faſting or praying.

And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer theſe patches, in the ende grevve in theſe partes to bee ſovved togither, yet the other partes of the vvorld vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:18269:32"/> other patriarches, were litle or not at all troubled with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And howſoeuer he ſhame not to aduouch, that now their manner of praying is according to the ſcriptures, <hi>Gregory. l.</hi> 7. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. writes, that, <hi>Mos Apoſtoloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuit,</hi> it was the maner of the Apoſtles, to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecrate onely with the Lords praier, which ſimplicity, who ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſcriptures. But to make it yet more euident, that of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he might worſt haue made this brag, of their manner of praying, there are two great &amp; notorious faults more therein: their praying for the dead to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, or to eaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the paines of purgatory, &amp; their praying, as they do, to <hi>Saintes</hi> &amp; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> For in theſe two points, they are not onely deſtitute of the teſtimony of the holy au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient fathers, conſent of al Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, preſcription of ſo long time as he makes ſhew of, and the ſcriptures, but rather al theſe are indeed herein againſt them. For purgatory it ſelfe, &amp; conſequently praiers made to releeue ſoules there, is but a very late deuiſe, &amp; neuer yet receiued of halfe of Chriſtendome. For in <hi>William Rufus</hi> time, king here of England, there being a councell held at <hi>Baron,</hi> there the Greek church, in this point plainly diſcented from the Latin, and neuer from that day to this, could be brought herein, to be of their minde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may gather, that it is a point, which the Latine church hath deuiſed, ſince the greek church broke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, &amp; that neuer yet, had either conſent of al chriſtian nations, or ſuch preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time, to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it, as he talkes of. And as for the ſcriptures, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be peruſed thorow, &amp; there ſhal not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in them that bee of the canon, either example of prayer, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the dead, yea rather plainely hee ſhal finde them, alwaies vrging the time of this preſent life, to bee the onely time, to doe good in, and to ſeeke the Lorde for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort euer after. And as for the other point, concerning their prayers to <hi>Saints</hi> departed and <hi>Angels,</hi> it is ſuch a thing, for the vvhich, in all the ſcripture they can finde neyther precept, promiſſe, nor example, to leade them to vſe it, but to teach them to abhor it, there they ſhall, or at leaſt may learne, that inuocation, is a ſpeciall diuine poynt of ſeruice, of ſuch ſpirituall and high nature, as that God challengeth it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himſelfe, &amp; that therefore neuer any holy man, mentioned
<pb facs="tcp:18269:32"/> in the ſcriptures durſt euer vſe it to any other. Indeede a man ſhall eaſily finde that ere <hi>Epiphanius</hi> time, Sathan had taught the heretiques called <hi>Caians,</hi> to worſhip Angels with inuocation of them, and that likewiſe ere his time in Africke there were, that offred to <hi>Mary</hi> the virgin, and that in inuocating her, and other ſaints were verie buſy, &amp; pretended great piety &amp; deuotion; but withal he ſhal finde, that he bitterly condemnes al that did ſo for heretiques, vnder the name either of <hi>Caians, Antidicomarianites,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now where, they would ſhift of the abſurdity, &amp; blaſphemy of robbing God, &amp; his ſonne Chriſt, of their due honour herein, in ſaying firſt, that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſouls of <hi>Saints</hi> departed, may aſwel ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the requiring of our brethren aliue to pray for vs, &amp; then in affirming, that they begge nothing at their hands, but ſtil they conclude their praiers vnto them, with this clauſe, by the merites of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, they cannot ſo eſcape or excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For neither doe they only deſire the <hi>Saints</hi> departed, to pray to God for them, as we doe our brethren here whiles they liue, neither do they alwaies remember ſo to conclude their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto them. For in their office, which they call the ſeruice of the bleſſed <hi>Marie,</hi> there bee three prayers made vnto her, wherein, no leſſe then eternall life is begged directly at her hands, &amp; yet there this clauſe is quite forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The like may be obſerued, in many other praiers of theirs to them, as for example, in their praier to <hi>S. Oſmund</hi> confeſſor, in one to <hi>S. Anne,</hi> and in an other to <hi>S. Katherin.</hi> And if it were ſo, that they ſo ſhut vp al their praiers vnto them, what were that elſe, then to make Chriſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt vs &amp; them? For can we in any words, more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge Chriſts effectual mediation betwixt vs and his father, then by requiring all things that wee begge of his father <hi>per dominnm noſtrum Ieſum Chriſtum,</hi> by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt? Then what is this elſe, but for their pleaſures to put him from his old office, of being mediator betwixt God and man, to make him nowe mediatour betwixt men and wemen aliue, and the ſouls of other men &amp; wemen dead? They ſay in their maner of praying, they neuer cauſe the <hi>Saints</hi> any more to incroch of his office of mediation, then wee doe when wee deſire one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18269:33"/> being aliue, to pray to god for vs, what ſay they then to that prayer of theirs in the name of <hi>Thomas Becket: Tu per Thomae ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro te effudit, fac nos, Chriſte, ſcandere quò Thomas aſcendit.</hi> That is, O thou Chriſt, by the bloode of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which for thee hee ſhed, make vs aſcend thither, whither <hi>Thomas</hi> is gone.

But if this be not plaine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, both to make it appeare that they pray otherwiſe to the Saints departed, then we doe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue: &amp; that in their praying to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moſt blaſphemouſly contrary to all holy ancient fathers iudgement, conſent of al Chriſtian nations, preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al ages, and the holy ſcriptures themſelues, marke (Chriſtian Reader) theſe further preſidents. In the maſſe of the annuntiation they ſing thus to <hi>Mary, Salue virgo virginum, mediatrix hominum,</hi> all haile virgin of virgins, the mediatrix of men: and in the maſſe of the conception thus, <hi>Tu ſpes certamiſerorum, verè mater orphanorum, tu lenamen oppreſſorum, medicamen infirmorum, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus es omnia.</hi> That is (ſpeaking to the ſame <hi>Mary</hi>) Thou art the certaine hope of the miſerable, truely the mother of orphans, the helpe of the oppreſſed, the medicine for the ſicke, to all thou art all things. Infinite ſuch examples there be, whereby it is moſt cleare, that nothing can bee begged of God himſelfe which they beg not of the ſaints, &amp; that no title ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to god but they haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to one Saint or other. Beſids al this, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that the children of God being aliue are commanded to pray one for another, &amp; that by ſpeech, letter, or meſſenger, they know how to acquaint one another with their minde: whereas in praying to their ſoules after their death, we haue neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo to doe, neither can we indeede perſuade our ſelues, that whatſoeuer we ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they heare and ſee our minds, vnles we thinke now after once they be in heauen, they are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the very nature of God himſelfe, &amp; ſo are become aſwell as he, ſearchers &amp; ſcers of the harts &amp; raines: which once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine becauſe it is extreame blaſphemy, therefore their is infinite difference, euen for theſe reaſons betwixt deſiring a Chriſtian brother aliue to pray for vs, &amp; the deſiring of his ſoule departed but once to doe ſo much for vs. Againe if that were but all they doe in praying to the Saints departed, then howſoeuer (becauſe of our frailty that ſticketh by vs whiles we liue) it were neceſſary one of vs to require that at the hands of another, that ſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:18269:33"/> vve may performe the duety one to another, yet their is not the like reaſon, why we ſhould ſo cal vpon them that are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though they could heare vs, for they being where they haue laide aſide all frailty and forgetfulneſſe of their dueties: it being ſuppoſed to be their dueties to pray for their brethren &amp; ſiſters in Chriſt aliue, we may be ſure they will do it without our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of them thus. But now no more of theſe two points here, for <hi>ca.</hi> thirty ſeuen, I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe ſomewhat largely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where I haue ſhewed both when and how theſe corruptions came in, and who reſiſted them alſo.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to goe on with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I haue vndertaken to anſwere, concerning that point, when and by vvhom the Romiſh religion came in, and vvho ſpyed it and confuted it: beſides the pointes already touched, amongſt many other wherein we differ from them, theſe are three principall, for the which I account both them &amp; their religion Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, their doctrine of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation, of images, and vowed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, and yet in theſe they bragge of fathers, conſent of Chriſtian regions, and preſcription of time, as in the former. To aunſwere therefore both that demaunde concerning theſe pointes, alſo and to ſtrip them withall of that viſard of antiquity and vniuerſallity, that herein along time they haue deceiued the ſimple people vvithall, vnderſtande, welbeloued in the Lord vvhoſoeuer thou art, firſt for tranſubſtantiation, the very archpiller of their Synagoge, that if they bee very buſie to ſeeke out who firſt gaue inkling of ſuch a matter, they ſhall finde indeede the originall thereof not to come from <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangeliſt, or anie of his fellowſhippe, but from one <hi>Marke</hi> a notable Magitian, and filthie heretique of the broode of <hi>

Indeed this fellow may very wel be allowed, for the firſt au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of this point of doctrin, for there being not any one point of popery, wherein Antichriſt, hath more manifeſtly ſhewed him ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Chriſt, then in this, as in truth there is not, becauſe for the eſtabliſhing &amp; vſe of this, he is both ſpoiled of the true nature of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; office of the only ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prieſt of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to offer himſelfe once for all for the redemption of his church, who can be fitter then this auncient enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter <hi>Marcus,</hi> to be the firſt author and patrone hereof? eſpecially ſeing <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſpeaking of him in the eight chapter of the foreſaid booke (as it ſhould ſeeme, ſecretly directed by the ſpirit of propheſy) ſaith, thas he was <hi>verè praecurſor Antichriſti,</hi> that is, truely Antichriſts fore-runner. Yet how notably ſoeuer this <hi>Marcus</hi> cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſimple perſons in his time, to beleeue his tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation of wine, into the bloud of Grace, yet he was ſo baited, detected, &amp; confounded for his lewd and coſening dealing therein, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points by <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius,</hi> and others, that howſoeuer in the meane time, Antichriſt his ſucceſſour, was buſie vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. in a councell at <hi>Vercellis,</hi> and after in the councell of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> vnder <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 2. about the yeare of the lord 1060. in bringing <hi>Berengarius</hi> to recantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to reuiue againe this doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, yet as their own friends confeſſe, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Tonſtall</hi> in his booke of the ſacrament of Chriſts body and bloud, it could not, nor was not, decreed for a certaine and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall doctrine, before <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirds time, in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Lateran,</hi> about the yeare of Chriſt 1215. before which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, the Greeke Church had ſeparated themſelues from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and therefore it being a point of Doctrine, not receaued as Catholike, before that diuiſion, neuer ſince could it be receaued in the Greeke Church for any Catholike truth. How can it then haue countenance of all Chriſtian Regions and times? <hi>Bertram, Berengarius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> in ſundry places by writing &amp; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, oppoſed themſelues againſt it, as witneſſeth <hi>Bertrams</hi> book of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the condemnation of <hi>Berengarius</hi> opinion about
<pb facs="tcp:18269:34"/> it at <hi>Vercellis,</hi> and the articles of the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> Yea a little before, and in this Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> time, a certaine people about <hi>Iohn de Albines Toloſſa</hi> called <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and that in great &amp; mighty mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes (as the French Cronicles ſhew) denied reall preſence of Chriſt vnder, or with the outward elements in this ſacrament, in ſomuch, as great warres were raiſed to ſubdue them. But of this matter alſo I haue ſpoken ſo much chapter eleuenth &amp; 17. that here I neede thereof ſay no more.</p>
               <p>Now touching Images or Idols, and the worſhipping thereof: I muſt needes confeſſe that for their dealing about them, they may very well pretend both antiquity and vniuerſality. For it appeares in all ſtories, and in the ſcriptures themſelues, that that way, not onely all other nations, but alſo euen the people of the Iewes themſelues, haue beene alwaies wonderfully giuen to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and defile themſelues, but withall it appeares, that god in his word writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, againſt no abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath cried out, either more often, or more vehemently, then againſt this. But amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the firſt that we reade of, that worſhipped the image of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> or any other, was <hi>Marcellina</hi> a filthy companion of the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall heretique <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> but both in <hi>Epiphanius hereſi</hi> 27. and in <hi>Auguſtine ad Quod vult deum,</hi> we finde this, both noted &amp; condemned amongſt other deteſtable errours of the <hi>Carpocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This <hi>Carpocrates</hi> liued in the beginning of the empire of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Pius, Anicet</hi> then being Biſhoppe of Rome, about the yeare of the lord 109. And in <hi>Origens</hi> time who died, as <hi>Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſis</hi> ſaith, in the yeare of Chriſt 261. hee in his ſeuenth book to <hi>Celſus</hi> noteth that then the Chriſtians neither ſuffered images nor pillers to be worſhipped. Likewiſe in <hi>Arnobius, aduerſus gentes,</hi> who floriſhed about the 300. yeare after Chriſt, it appeares, that the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils obiected that, as a matter of diſgrace, againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they neither had, nor worſhipped any ſuch. But ſo far of was it, that the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought it any diſgrace vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in the place before quoted ſaith, that the Iewes &amp; Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hearing the law <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. not only refuſe images of god, chooſing rather to die, then to make or worſhip any ſuch, adding this as a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that god is inuiſible &amp; without body. And likewiſe <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> (who floriſhed 100. yeares before <hi>Origen</hi>) in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the heathen, confeſſes willingly this their obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be true, that Chriſtians had no images that might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb facs="tcp:18269:35"/> by ſence, but onely by vnderſtanding, becauſe to vſe that deceitfull art, ſaieth he, was forbid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea and that Chriſtians and their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples might continue ſtill free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, in a councel held in Spaine at <hi>Eliberis, can</hi> 36. it was decreed thus, It hath pleaſed vs to determine that no pictures ſhould be ſuffered in churches, leaſt that which is worſhipped or adored ſhould be painted in walles. <hi>Iſid. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci.</hi> And therfore <hi>Epiphaniꝰ</hi> 55. yeares after this councell, about the yeare of Chriſt 390. as it appeares in his Epiſtle to <hi>Iohn</hi> of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, finding in the entrance of the church at Anablatha in that <hi>Iohns</hi> dioces, the image of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pictured on a cloth there ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, puld it downe &amp; tare it aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, &amp; writing to the foreſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> about it (though as he confeſſed it ſeemed vnto him that it was made for the picture of <hi>Ieſus</hi> or ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the Saints) yet he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth it as contrary both to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Chriſtian Religion, &amp; therefore perſwades him not to ſuffer any ſuch thing any more, for it became him to baniſh ſuch ſuperſtition which was vnſeemely for the Church of Chriſt. Yea <hi>Lactantius lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 19. of his diuine inſtitutions ſaieth flatly, that their can be no Religion where there is an image, he liued &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the yeare 320. And S <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who liued after al theſe before named, for he died not before the yeare 430. <hi>de conſenſu Euangeliſtarum lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 2. writeth that they euen deſerue to erre which ſeeke Chriſt and his Apoſtles, not in bookes, but in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wals.

All theſe things notwithſtanding, neuer were images, pillers and croſſes more idolatrouſly decreed to be worſhipped their, nor euer were idols more groſly adored of heretiques, or the very pagans and heathen, then they haue bene &amp; yet be of ſuperſtitious Papiſts. For they crouch &amp; kneele
<pb facs="tcp:18269:36"/> vnto them, preſent offerings before them, they run a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto them, and teach that they are to be worſhipped with that honour, that is due vnto them, whoſe images and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they be, though in an other manner, not for their owne ſakes, but for theirs whoſe remembrances they be. But indeed if in worſhipping of them, they did not principally reſpect the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages themſelues, why ſhould there not be as great deuotion, as many pilgrimages, &amp; as great offerings, preſented &amp; yeelded to the image of Chriſt, <hi>Mary,</hi> or of any other: aſwell in one place as in an other? Well, howſoeuer they will do wickedly herein, and when they haue done, ſeeke to colour the matter, ſuch in truth all the worlde ſees, herein hath beene their dealing, that <hi>Euthymius</hi> in his panoply had neuer more cauſe to name the <hi>Armenians,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Idolaters to the croſſe, for their groſſe and ſuperſtitious worſhipping of it, then we haue generally to count, and call, the Romaniſts flat idolaters for their behauiour towards it, and other images alſo. Thus then hoping by this, that I haue ſaid, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point, that not onely thou maieſt ſee (goodreader) when, and how, this point of popery firſt came in, but how, and by whom, it hath beene oppugned, but conſequently alſo, that the Romiſh church is herein deſtitute both of ſcripture, fathers, conſent of Chriſtian regions, and al that ſhe bragges of, let vs ſee if wee can ſhew the like, concerning the other point of forced ſingle life vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the clergy, which ſhe holds to be ſo neceſſary, and holy an ordinance, as that by no meanes without deadly ſin it may be tranſgreſſed.</p>
               <p>Euen in this, as in the former, if we ſearch the monumentes of antiquity well, we ſhal finde that they haue very auncient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, to be their firſt fathers &amp; leaders. For the <hi>Tacianiſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cald <hi>Encratites</hi> of their abſtinence from mariage, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other thinges, who began about the yeare, one hundred forty two, were great condemners of mariage, as appeares in <hi>Aug. ad Quodvult Deum,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> writing of them, <hi>Hereſi.</hi> 46. After them ſpronge vp the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who in like manner were enemies to mariage, but not ſo vniuerſally as the former, for they permitted it to others, and reſtraine onely their clergy from it, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they calde their elect, as <hi>Auguſt:</hi> witneſſeth of them <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 74. but indeed as many as would be perfect, &amp; had in anie great reckoning amongſt them, they were in any caſe to abſtaine from
<pb facs="tcp:18269:36"/> mariage. And as we finde, that theſe and other heretiques, were the fore-runners of the Papiſts in this point, ſo we finde that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Epiphanius,</hi> and others, that wrote againſt them, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this for a doctrine of deuils in them. But I know they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that herein we do them wrong in that we reſemble them to theſe, for theſe, they ſay, made this the reaſon and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their doing, that they held mariage it ſelfe, to be an vncleane and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy eſtate of life, and therefore not fit for them, that would ſerue the Lord, to liue in. Which, they ſay, they doe not hold. Indeed, thus it is their faſhion, when for any of their abſurd errours, they are preſſed with our obiections againſt them, then ſomewhat to avoide the extremity of the foile, to ſet a farre better ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then otherwiſe, either their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> practiſe or doctrine will beare: but when they finde the chaſe ended, and themſelues by ſuch ſhifting in ſome ſort, as they think, to haue eſcaped, then hauing recouered their breath againe, they fall to their olde flat groſnes in the point in their life and teaching. And euen ſo deale they in this. For their whole and generall practiſe, makes it moſt euident, in that they rather tolerate their Prieſts to haue concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, to run to the ſtues, yea and to commit Sodomitry, then to mary, that indeed they think mariage is more vncleane, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files their Prieſthoode more then all theſe. And Diſt. 82. <hi>Gratian</hi> cites a ſaying of Pope <hi>Siritius,</hi> wherein, in plainer termes he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouches them that holdes, that miniſters of the Goſpell may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and beget children as the Prieſts of the olde teſtament did, to be followers of luſts, and therein teachers of vice. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diuinity it came, that the ſame <hi>Siritius</hi> would perſuade, that therefore the miniſters of the Goſpell might not mary, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, they that liue in the fleſh cannot pleaſe god, as though to liue in the fleſhe with <hi>Paul,</hi> and to liue in the ſtate of mariage were all one: which if it had beene ſo, what meant S. <hi>Paul</hi> to teach 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. that he that beſtowed his daughter in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage did well, that mariage is honourable <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. and that they that deny in hypocriſy, the lawfulnes thereof, are ſuch, as haue therein giuen eare vnto doctrines of deuils, and thereby ſhewe, that their conſciences are burnt, as it were, with an hote iron, and that they are departed from the faith 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. But they will ſay perhaps, they are now aſhamed of this olde <hi>Siritius,</hi> &amp; of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this point. Doubtles if they be not, there is iuſt cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:18269:37"/> why they ſhould, but I haue two reaſons why I thinke they are not: firſt, becauſe he was Pope of Rome they know; then, becauſe even of late one <hi>Gregory Martin,</hi> a great learned man (as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him) writing againſt our Engliſh tranſlations <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. writeth of this point euen now (as though that Popes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtill directed him) flatly, that by mariage their Prieſthoode is prophaned, and made meere laicall and popular. Wherefore I ſee not, but that they are and may worthily ſtill of vs herein be ſaied to be, the right ſchollers &amp; ſucceſſours of the former here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. Howbeit this I muſt needes further graunt them, that in peruſing the writings of ancient fathers and Cronicles of times, I find eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt them, that otherwiſe yet ſeemed to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and not heretiques, and that of very ancient time, and ſo from time to time, that haue beene fauorers and vrgers of ſingle life in miniſters. For I finde by that that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath writen of this matter in the 3. &amp; 7. booke. <hi>Stromat,</hi> who flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed within 200. yeares after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome earneſtly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſingle life, as a life moſt holy &amp; fit for ſuch. And I know that in the councell of Nice, in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, it was atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, that there ſhould bee made a canon, to binde miniſters vniuerſally to liue ſingle, without the vſe or company of wiues: &amp; that after that <hi>Siritius</hi> before ſpoken of, about the yeare 390. after him <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt <hi>ann.</hi> 600. or thereabout, &amp; after that ſundry other Popes, namely &amp; eſpecially about 1000. years after Chriſt, &amp; after; were marueilous eger and buſy, by their owne authority &amp; decrees of councels ſummoned by their meanes, to eſtabliſh &amp; ratify this point. Whereupon (as in other cuntreies of theſe weſterne parts, to pleaſe them withal) herein England many Biſhops, as namely <hi>Lancfranke, Du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtane</hi> &amp; <hi>Anſelme,</hi> Archbiſhops of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury, were marueilous forward in their times to further this deuice. By mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whereof, many decrees paſt in ſmodes and councels, and many great things were atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted &amp; done to this end. But yet then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand withall (welbeloued) that <hi>Clemens</hi> in the places before quoted, confuted &amp; withſtoode notably theſe hypocrits, both by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples &amp; reaſons eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now vſed by vs againſt theſe their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: that one <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice though vnmaried himſelfe, did ſo effectually withſtand that atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, that it did not there paſſe: that <hi>Siritius</hi> was by a Biſhop of <hi>Terragon</hi> confuted &amp; withſtood: &amp; that <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt vpon the finding of 600. chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens heads, after the caſting of certaine great ponds neare vnto
<pb facs="tcp:18269:37"/> the aboad of many, inforced to that vow of ſingle life, reuoked his determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it appeareth in an epiſtle of one <hi>Hulricke,</hi> Biſhop of Auguſta, to Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi>) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it was better to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marry, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue occaſion of ſuch murder. Further in <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands</hi> time, who after he was Pope was called <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, though we find that he of al that we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before him, was herein moſt extreame and went furtheſt, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we read in <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, H. Mutiꝰ</hi> &amp; others, that he and his decrees in this point were openly &amp; ſtoutly reſiſted, not onely at <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> &amp; <hi>Mentz</hi> in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, but alſo by the Biſhops of France, and other cuntreies both by open preaching &amp; liuing with their wiues, doe what he could, and his ſucceſſors for a great ſpace. Hee was the firſt that bound Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops vpon their oath to admit none into the miniſtry, vnleſſe firſt they would vow a ſingle life: &amp; yet after he had done what he could, &amp; <hi>Paſcalis</hi> that ſucceeded him, &amp; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi> alſo their chaplein here, to cauſe that decree to take place: yet, as our Cronicles ſhew, <hi>Gerhardus</hi> Archbiſhop of Yorke, wrote to that <hi>Anſelme,</hi> that thoſe that came for orders to him would not vow ſingle life. And howſoeuer they preuailed in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before, <hi>Polidor</hi> ſaith, that the reſtraint of their mariages began here firſt to be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted <hi>ann.</hi> 670. <hi>hiſt.

Yea <hi>Aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinus l</hi> 5. <hi>hiſtoriae Bioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And none of any learning are ignorant, that al theſe ſturs about this matter notwitſtanding, Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhops &amp; miniſters in al other quarters of the world, vnder the other Patri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>arches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning vnto this day, haue bene, are maried &amp; beget childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, after they are entred into the miniſtry. This al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo is as wel knowen of the learned, that not onely particular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, &amp; holy fathers, as I noted before, &amp; others: but alſo ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, where multitudes of ſuch fathers haue met, haue wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten &amp; decreed to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; contrary the going forward of this Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Yea they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hereof, as it appears by ſundry things ſet downe both in their text and gloſſe <hi>diſt.</hi> 81.84. &amp; elſwhere in their Canon law. For in the 28. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is noted a decree of the councell of <hi>Gangra,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300. yeares after Chriſt, whereby he is by the authority of that councell anathematized, that ſhall for his mariage put
<pb facs="tcp:18269:38"/> difference betwixt a maried miniſters miniſtry, and another, and therefore abſtaine from communicating with him, and there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is cited a canon fathered of the Apoſtles, whereby he is accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that puts away his wife for Religion ſake. And in the ſixth generall councell held at Conſtantinople, theſe thinges are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with other, and therefore there it was decreed, <hi>Tom. Conc.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. that he ſhall be depoſed, that after that, ſhould go about to debar Prieſts, or deacons, either of mariage, or of the vſe of their wiues, yea after ordination: and there alſo, further it was enacted, that if they themſelues being ordred, ſhould vnder pretence of piety put away their wiues, that they ſhall therefore be excommunicate, and yet this was 680. yeares after Chriſt. Moreouer <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaking of his time, ſaith, that then, <hi>plurum ſacerdotes habebant matrimonia,</hi> that is, moſt Prieſtes were maried, <hi>aduerſus Iouinianum, libro.</hi> 1. <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelfe was a maried man, as it appeareth by his writing to his wife. To holde that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may not mary, <hi>Ignatius ad Philadelphenſes</hi> ſaith, comes of the deuill: And <hi>Dionyſius Corinthiacus</hi> writing to the <hi>Gnoſians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades their Biſhop <hi>Pinitus,</hi> not to impoſe an vnneceſſary, &amp; too heauy a burden of ſingle life, or chaſtity vpon the brethren, as we reade in <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Laſtly, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> (though he liued about the yeare 1120. which was a very corrupt time for this matter,) yet euen he, in his ſixty ſixth ſermon vppon the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, thus far concerning this point hath plainely written. Take from the church honourable matrimonie, &amp; the bed vndefiled, ſaith he, and thou filleſt it with concubine keepers, with inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, with ſuch as haue vncleane iſſues of ſeede flowing from them, with wantons, with Sodomites, and all kind of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſons. But when the bright euidence of theſe allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeme to make them ſomewhat to bold downe their heads, yet I know they haue this ſhift for their laſt refuge, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but that ſuch as haue been maried, or at that preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, haue wiues, may enter into the miniſtry, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they muſt be ſuch, as voluntary will vow, and performe a ſingle life, and ſo thence forth abſtaine: inſomuch that they are ſo in loue with this ſhift, that they ſay, &amp; write, as is to be ſeen in the Rhemiſh notes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that <hi>Pauls</hi> canons, touching the being of ſuch the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of one wife, are ſo to be vnderſtood, &amp; not ſo, as that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or after once he is miniſter, he may continue the office of a
<pb facs="tcp:18269:38"/> husband towardes his wife, and confidently they dare and doe brag, that we neuer read of any other that maried, or got children after they entred once into holy orders. Wherin firſt the practiſe of the Greeke Church, &amp; all other Churches, but theſe in theſe parts of the world, directly croſſes them. Againe let <hi>Pauls</hi> words in deliuering of his canons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the qualities that miniſters ought to haue, bee well conſidered, and any man ſhall ſee, that it is abſurd ſo to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him, that he requires that they ſhould be ſo qualified only <hi>de praeterito</hi> for the time paſt, &amp; not rather eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the time preſent and to come. Seeing they are ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in this, that none maried euer, or begot children after they were miniſters, let them tell mee of whom Peter had his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Petronella,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne Croniclcs ſpeake ſo much, had he her not of a lawful wife? And if it be true, that we read, that in the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder <hi>Domitian,</hi> ſhe was of ſuch floriſhing yeares, that then <hi>Flaccus,</hi> a noble Roman county would haue had her to wife, the time betwixt that and <hi>Peters</hi> entring vpon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, being at the leaſt, fifty fiue yeares after Chriſt, by all likelihoode ſhee was got after hee was an Apoſtle. And well might it bee, for it being euident, that Chriſt had taught them, that vnleſſe it were for fornication no man ſhould forſake his wife <hi>Math.</hi> 19. and therefore that <hi>Paul</hi> hath noted, that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Lord and <hi>Cephas,</hi> did cary vp and downe in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Apoſtleſhippes their wiues, being alſo conuerted aſwell as themſelues, and therefore ſiſters 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. taking mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for themſelues &amp; then as they went, that ſometime in that perigrinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs, in the diſcharge of their office, this <hi>Petronel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> was borne. For it being euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the Goſpell of <hi>Math.</hi> 8. that <hi>Peter</hi> had a wife, and by their owne ſtories, that ſhee was a liue a little before his death, &amp; at Rome with him, &amp; that he counted not his Apoſtleſhip fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that neither he would leaue his wiues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; take other women with him, nor that ſhe came to Rome rather in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of other men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him her owne husband: too too groſſe and abſurd is it with them to thinke, that he &amp; the reſt of the Apoſtles that had wiues, forſooke their wiues quite and went vp and downe rather after the popiſh maner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with other women. Their tranſlating and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the order of <hi>Paules</hi> words, a woman, a ſiſter, will not defend their interpretation, for he placeth his wordes thus, a ſiſter,
<pb facs="tcp:18269:39"/> a wife, where in the later place it is abſurd, the Greek word being that which ſometime ſtandeth generally for a woman, ſometime for ſuch a woman as is alſo a wife; to take it in the former ſence, for then therein there were a needleſſe tautology, for there is no ſiſter, but ſhee is a woman alſo. But to leaue <hi>Peter</hi> with his wife and daughter, what can they ſay to <hi>Socrates,</hi> who in his fift booke and twentieth one Chapter of his ſtory, writeth that <hi>omnes praeſbyteri illuſtres,</hi> that is, all renouned miniſters in the Eaſt and Biſhops alſo, if they will, no law compelling them, may obſtaine from their wiues, for not a fewe of them, whiles they are Biſhops, beget childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their lawfull wiues. <hi>Hiſtoriae tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partitae lib.</hi> 9. <hi>ca.</hi> 38. Againe the 10. canon of the <hi>Ancyran</hi> councell teſtifieth of many authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticall exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of ſuch as maried after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders. Moreouer in the daies of <hi>Iulian</hi> the apoſtata wee reade, that <hi>Baſilius</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and <hi>Euſichius</hi> a miniſter at the leaſt of Ceſarea of Cappadocia, which had lately taken to wife a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and was but then as a bridegrome, both ended their liues in martirdome, as writeth <hi>Zozomene lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and <hi>Balfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> long after, vpon the 10. canon of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth a decree of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, whereby it was lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within two yeares after they were ordered to mary. And who can be perſwaded, that we reading of ſo many famous Biſhoppes that were maried, as namely of <hi>Demetrianus</hi> of Antioch, of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi> in the councell of Nice, &amp; of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> &amp; others, and of infinite children of theſe Biſhops &amp; of others of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, as we doe in all ſtories: that they got none of theſe children after their miniſtry, or that they left their wiues preſently vpon their entring into their miniſtry, eſpecially ſeeing the ſtories that tels vs they were maried &amp; names vs their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth no ſuch thing? Howſoeuer it were with theſe, it euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeares in his 70. and 127. epiſtles, that there was one <hi>Syneſius</hi> an excellent learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Biſhop of Ptolemais who was not only a maried ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and had children, but that he begot children of his lawfull wife, being and continuing ſtill in the execution of his office. And many more ſuch examples might be remembred, but theſe are ſufficient to ſhew the impudency of their confident aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there were neuer anie ſuch: and this which I haue faied, I hope, alſo is fully ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſhew not onely the vanity of his brag that made this preface, that all is well with them and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:18269:39"/> by fathers, conſent of regions &amp;c. but alſo to anſwere the demuande or obiection which I tooke vpon mee, vpon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to anſwere in this place, concerning the beginning and proceeding of popery, and how and by whom it was reſiſted. For euen, as I haue ſhewed, they lacke all the countinance they brag of, for thoſe particular points that I haue here ſpoken of, &amp; haue made it plaine, that both their beginning and proceeding hath beene noted and withſtoode: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo is it an eaſy matter to deale with them, in all the reſt of the points wherein they and wee differ, as ere thou haſt redde this my anſwere to <hi>Albine</hi> thorow, I hope, I ſhall make vnto thee full demonſtration. Wherefore thou maieſt in the meane time hereby learne, to arme thy ſelfe againſt ſuch proud brags, as notwithſtanding thou haſt hard the authour of this preface make. For I hope euen by this, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he hath ſaied to the contrary, thou moſt plainely ſeeſt, that neither ſcripture, fathers, conſent of regions, nor continuance of time can proue, that they haue, as he brags, the true Goſpell, and the true ſence of it, the true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the true Church &amp; ſpouſe of Chriſt, who haue in theſe maine &amp; principall points beene controled and condemned, in all theſe as I haue ſhewed. Whatſoeuer therefore he infers or buildes vpon this falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or whatſoeuer after, vpon the bare ſuppoſing the ſame to be true, thou ſhalt reade <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> railingly in his triumphant &amp; arrogant maner to ſpeake, in diſgrace of vs, our Church, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Religion: I hope, I ſay, thou wilt eſteeme of it, as of vaine and fooliſh wordes, of proud and yet malitious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Yet hauing thus anſwered in this ſort his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, ſomewhat the better to prepare thee to iudge of <hi>Iohn de Albine,</hi> and my anſwere vnto him: giue mee leaue now to ſay ſomewhat concerning his booke and his maner of dealing therein.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to proceede, hauing peruſed and as throughly, as I could, conſidered of it (gentle Reader) I proteſt vnto thee vpon what occaſion ſoeuer it hath got ſuch credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men of his owne conſort, that it hath not onely of them beene thought worthy to be publiſhed in Engliſh, but alſo to be intituled, <hi>A notable diſcourſe againſt hereſies,</hi> I haue found it, and ſo ſhall any indifferent Reader of this my anſwere vnto it, not able at all to doe either good or harme, but
<pb facs="tcp:18269:40"/> onely to ſuch as are verie ſimple, vnlearned and ſilly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant creatures. For the principall queſtions in hand, either alwaies he takes for graunted, and ſo neuer goes about to proue them: or ſubtlely &amp; ſuddainly (ſeeming to haue vndertaken the proofe of them) hee ſlippeth into another matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with goeth on luſtely, as though he were buſy about the point in controuerſy, when as indeede he hath left that quite, and choſen to himſelfe ſome other matter more eaſie for him to deale in, either not at all in controuerſy, or howſoeuer, to ſmall purpoſe for the proofe of the thing intended. And yet thus hee ſeemeth vnto himſelfe, and vnto his vnskilfull Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to haue wonne the cauſe and to carrie all before him, when indeede hee hath ſaied quite nothing to the purpoſe, and hath buſied himſelfe onely about that which was needeleſſe: which to the ende that thou maieſt the better obſerue thy ſelfe in the reſt of his booke, I will giue thee a taſt of, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof. Vnderſtand therefore, that whereas his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and principall ſcope is, in his whole diſcourſe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace our miniſtry, and the whole matter thereof, our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that ſo hauing once perſwaded his Reader, that we haue neither lawfull miniſters, nor ſound Religion, hee might conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently boldely pronounce vs to bee heretiques, and our whole Church ſchiſmaticall &amp; hereticall. To effect this his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe hee ſoreſawe, that firſt it were neceſſarie that he ſhould iuſtify their owne miniſtry and Religion, before hee ſhould ſo call ours into queſtion: firſt hee laboureth about that in the firſt eight Chapters, &amp; then ſtriueth about the other in the reſt. But marke now, I beſeech thee, how he makes his entry into this ſo weighty and neceſſary a point. Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede out of the fift to the Hebrewes wee obiect (as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) that their calling to their Prieſthoode &amp; Prelacies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, becauſe their very offices themſelues were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Gods owne ordinance, but onelie of mans owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: though to anſwere this obiection, euery man might ſee, and he himſelfe ſaw (as it appeares by his owne words <hi>ca.</hi> 1.) that it was moſt neceſſary for him firſt to haue proued, that their offices were of Gods inſtitution, and not of mans inuention onely, like a cunning Sophiſter, hee ſlippes from that, promiſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome other place to proue it, which yet though it
<pb facs="tcp:18269:40"/> ſtoode him in this his diſcourſe neuer ſo much vpon, he neuer ſo much as once remembreth or mentioneth againe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus onely ſuppoſing and taking this for grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that their Prieſthoode and Prelacies are of God (which he knowes we will neuer graunt them) hee takes vpon him to proue onely their comming thereunto to bee lawfull, which he proues as ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly alſo. For to proue it, hee onely ſaieth, that they come to them by the ordinary way, by right ſucceſſion of Biſhops and paſtours, continuing in one Catholicke faith, downe from Chriſt to this preſent time: thus childiſhly begging in one piece of one ſhort ſentence theſe foure great points (all which in this caſe are betwixt vs and them in queſtion) namely, that their officers all of them, come to their roomes by the ordinary way, that they haue right ſucceſsion, right Biſhops and paſtours, and ſounde and Apoſtolicke doctrine. And yet though he knew well enough, that wee conſtantly deny all theſe, yet to proue that they come lawfully to their offices, hee onely nakedly and barely affirmeth them, as though he preſumed, that he was and ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> in the conceit of all his Readers, that for him once to ſay it, were enough and enough againe. For by and by after that thus he had onely ſaied, hauing vſed neither proofe nor colour of proofe to backe his ſaying, hee ſlippeth into another matter, not yet called in queſtion: Whither a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, knowen, and alwaies a demonſtrable, perſonall, and locall ſucceſsion of Biſhops &amp; paſtours, be neceſſary for the perpetuall continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Church, and preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the trueth therin? And thus hee windeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matter to matter, leauing alwaies that vnproued, which hee had moſt neede to haue proued, labouring &amp; ſweating continually about the proofe of that, which though it were grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him, yet he might wel enough looſe his cauſe. As for example, hauing entred into the foreſaid matter in maner before ſaied, in 3. or 4. whole Chapters following, he ſhewes how the trueth is continued in the Church by ſucceſſion of paſtours, how profitable their miniſtry is, to bring men to, &amp; to ſettle them in the truth, that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> way by Chriſts ſheepe, downe from Chriſt to this day, that the ancient Catholicke faith, that the faith which in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time was helde and taught at Rome, &amp; had vnto their times beene continued from Chriſt by ſucceſsion of Biſhoppes and paſtours, is the waie and
<pb facs="tcp:18269:41"/> faith that a Catholicke man muſt liue and die in, whoſoeuer ſaieth to the contrary. In which propoſitions, no maruaile though he goe on roundly, for he hath winde and weather with him, &amp; none of vs gaineſaies him; yea theſe things being rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, wee conſtantly affirme and teach the ſame But theſe things being all graunted him, what is hee nearer his cauſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet all the ſort of them neuer could, nor ſhall bee able to proue, that their paſtours ſucceed Chriſt, his Apoſtles, or the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent holy Biſhops &amp; paſtours, that were before <hi>Irenaeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Avgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> time, in teaching the ſame doctrine that they taught? But herein is his popiſh ſubtlely, that ſtanding thus vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe points, he would haue his Reader grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him all theſe: that their ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Prieſts &amp; Biſhops is that ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of paſtours, ſo profitable for the continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the trueth and Church: that their Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that now is, is that ancient way that Chriſts ſheepe haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies trod, &amp; ſo the ancient Catholicke Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, they &amp; the holy paſtours &amp; Biſhops at Rome and elſe where had, ſoundly ſucceeding one another from the Apoſtles, continued in vnto that time; which are things whereof not one, the Pope and all his confederates ſhall euer be able in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to proue: and therefore it ſeemeth <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> thought it good policy, ſeeing theſe thinges could be got no otherwiſe, to trie whether he could get them thus by flatte begging of them. And it ſeemeth alſo, that hee preſumed, that hee ſhould come onely to ſuch liberall mens dores, that all theſe ſhould be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and giuen him, euen at the very firſt asking: for alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he behaues himſelfe in ſuch ſort, as that without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he had them all graunted him. Onely a little in his thirty ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Chapter, belike ſomewhat growing aſhamed of his ſhameleſſe begging al the while before, he begins to make ſhew, that if men ſhould be ſo hard harted, as to deny him, that their paſtours, doctrine and Church are ſound &amp; Catholicke, that he is able to proue them ſo to bee, whither ſuch will or no. And yet euen there, when all comes to all (though indeede hee bragge, that he could and would, but for being too tedious to his Reader, iuſtify the reſt of their doctrine, by the teſtimony of a number of doctours, holy confeſſours and martyrs) he onely by muſtering of a ſort of dumbe doctours vpon the ſtage, makes his poore Reader beleeue, that in the places quoted by him, they
<pb facs="tcp:18269:41"/> ſpeake directly to iuſtify their ceremonies, their Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, praier for the dead and to the dead, as though theſe were the principall matters in controuerſy betwixt them and vs. But doubtles hee knew well enough, that no one of his Readers amongſt an hundred, would and could turne the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo try whither the men he name, make there ſo for him or no. For otherwiſe, for ſhame he would not haue quoted them ſo negligently, falſely and corruptly, as when I come to that place, I ſhall ſhew thee hee hath. Theſe thinges conſidered (Chriſtian Reader) thou muſt bee very ſimple and haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand thy minde wholy foreſtalled with his falſe principles, or elſe hee ſhall winne with thee little credit to his cauſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to ours. Howbeit, ſeeing both his whole drift, and his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers in his preface, was (as it euidently thereby appeares) vnder the odious names of heretiques and ſchiſmatiques, to diſgrace vs and the trueth that wee profeſſe (as though it were not once to be called in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whither they and their crue, were the onely ſound Catholickes and Chriſtians in the world) before I let thee proceede, &amp; come to the view of his declamation made to that ende, and of my anſwere thereunto: this vpon good and moſt cleare ground I proteſt vnto thee and aſſure thee, what brags ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he, or any other of his fellows make, of their popiſh and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion, that now is proſeſſed amongſt them: beſides all other things that can or may be ſaied againſt it, it is ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and their Church the vpholder thereof ſuch a dame, as is the very nurſe and baude of monſtrous impietie, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably iniurious to the right of the good eſtates of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and their people; and as laſtly (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it may ſeeme to carry a ſhew of holineſſe) it is not ſo, but indeede cunningly vnder the colour thereof, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at no marke more, then to aduaunce the pride, pompe, and gaine of her louers. The firſt is euident, in that their doctrine of their Popes ſupermacy is ſuch, as that for money hee may pardon any ſinne (as their practiſe teacheth) either committed, or to be committed: yea their verie Hedge-prieſtes by the authority of the power of abſolution giuen vnto them, vpon penaunce done, how light ſoeuer, if it ſo ſeeme good vnto them, haue and doe take vpon them marueilouſly, that way to breede immunity and impunity, by their abſoluing
<pb facs="tcp:18269:42"/> whom &amp; for what they liſt. Their doctrine alſo of ſatisfaction for ſinne, in that they allow ſprinkling of holy water, going on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, doing of this outwarde trifling thing, or that, which eaſily may be done of any carnal man, to be good ſatisfactory meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to anſwere God withal for their ſinnes: how can it be otherwiſe but the people meaſuring and iudging of ſinne according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, muſt needs thinke ſinne, that can be ſatisfied for ſo eaſily and lightly, to be but a ſleight matter. Their doctrine alſo of eare ſhriſt, is likewiſe a meanes to acquaint their ſingle prieſtes, with all the lewd huſwiues in their pariſhees, and ſo an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, with the trickes &amp; waies how, and the parties with whom, they may commit filthineſſe. Yea their forced ſingle life (as experience notoriouſly hath taught) hath infected earth and aire, with monſtrous vncleanneſſe of the fleſh, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, naturall &amp; vnnaturall, &amp; with infinite mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of poore infantes, the better ſtill to hide their iniquity. And while they teach that ſimple fornication is not ſo ill in their cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as to vſe a lawfull wife, that the firſt inwarde motions to ſinne or concupiſcence not conſented vnto, be no ſinnes, that manie ſinnes euen for their owne littlenes are veniall, &amp; not worthy of damnation: they make men ſecure for theſe, and ſo the fitter &amp; bolder to go on in the reſt. Their doctrine and practiſe of diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and pardons for money, for clergy and people almoſt for any thing, is, and muſt needs be, the roote and fountaine of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful many abhominations. Their doctrine of ſanctuaries, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, exemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and immunities of their clergy &amp; others, are very great occaſions of ſinne and impiety. Laſtly, the ambition, pride, tyranny, pompe, gluttony, wantonnes and inſatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes of their Popes, Cardinals and Prelats, makes al, whom they bewich with their religion, to thinke, that they are not to be blamed, if in theſe things they imitate then their holy fathers: &amp; marueilouſly are they incouraged to continue and ſpend their daies in theſe, &amp; in al other ſinnes, when as by their doctrine they are put in hope, if they die (beleeuing blindly as the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, providing of their goods, which they muſt needs leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, ſomwhat liberally, that maſſes, dirges &amp; trentals may be ſaied and ſong for them, and that ſuch other things done as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ghoſtly father ſhal appoint them) that in the end they ſhall doe well enough, how looſely and lewdly ſoeuer otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:18269:42"/> they liued before.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point alſo, is many waies cleare and apparent. For firſt by their doctrine of their Popes ſupremacy, where it is in the full force, Emperours, Kings &amp; Queenes, are thereby made and marde at their pleaſure: they muſt not thinke ſcorne of moſt baſe ſeruice and ſubiection to them, their ſubiectes ſhall be bound to pay them tribute no longer, or to yeelde them any maner of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duety, further then they liſt: yea it ſhall be lawfull for them, to conſpire againſt their naturall Princes, &amp; by any meanes they can, to deuiſe to depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of their liues and kingdome, if ſo the Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund them. Nay not onely vpon the Popes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and pardon, ſhall this of them bee counted lawfull and meritorious: but if any of his ovvne motion vndertake ſuch a thing, of a deuout minde to his holmes and religion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and abſolution of euery Maſſe-prieſt ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to iuſtifie the action, and to cauſe the party, that hath done it, to be canonized a Saint for his labour. Further for the eſtabliſhing of this archpiller of popery, their Popes ſupremacy, Princes are depriued of the election of their Prelates, and they are by oath ſo obliged to the Pope, and ſo freed from the iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their lawfull Prince, that they may and dare beard their Princes: and howſoeuer they wil take liberty to enioy great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions vnder them, yet in effect they are no ſubiectes vnto them, but rather altogither ſtand at the deuotion of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Potentate. Secondly, by the pretended right of this their ſupremacy, for the better maintenaunce of the ſwelling pompe thereof, to the great weakning of Chriſtian ſtates, they haue taken vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet doe, when they may be ſuffred, by their annates, Peeter-pence, Paul-fees, firſt-fruits, tenths, lones, oppreſsions, taxations, impoſitions, and infinite ſuch other deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſauoring of nothing elſe, but of inſatiable couetouſnes, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey away the treaſure, riches, and wealth of euery cuntrey, from out of it to Rome. And by this their ſupremacy, they haue firſt weakned, after rent in two, &amp; laſtly brought in effect to nothing, the glorious Roman Empire, that ſo the better they might haue roome to grow vp in, and that for their ſins in the iuſtice of God, Chriſtendome might the more eaſily become a pray to the Turke. Thirdly, by the deuiſe of their Auricular Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion they haue, and may haue, moſt perfect intelligence of the ſecretes of
<pb facs="tcp:18269:43"/> all ſtates where they haue to doe, then which can any thing in theſe outward things bee more dangerous, to the ſafe and good eſtate of Princes? Fourthly, by the force of ſingle life, they haue cauſed priuies, and ponds, &amp; ſuch other by corners to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe vp and deſtroy, in euery Chriſtian kingdome where they ruled, as many infants, as might, being growen to be men, haue beene able, in the fielde, to defend there Prince and cuntrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the enemies thereof: vvhich vvhat a vveakning to Chriſtian Princes and their kingdomes it hath beene, vvho ſeeth not? Theſe thinges therefore conſidered, it is to bee marueiled, that any Chriſtian ſtate, can or will tolerate, either them, or their religion in it.</p>
               <p>And as for the laſt point, that ſo their religion might fit the title appointed it by the Spirit of God, that is, that indeede it might proue it ſelfe to be,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note> a very miſtery of iniquity, euen throughout vnder the ſhevv of holineſſe and deuotion, they alvvaies haue hid, nouriſhed, and maintained groſſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and haue aymed at nothing more, then at their owne pompe and aduantage. For their doctrines of free-vvill, of mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe to keepe and ouer keepe the law of God, of merits &amp; ſatisfaction for our ſelues or others aliue or dead, of the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints or Angels: and their doctrines, that the Pope cannot erre, that he hath ſuch ſupremacy as they giue him, and that the ſcriptures haue their ſence and authority from his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, howſoeuer they paint theſe things with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewes of care to prouoke and incourage men to good works, and with deuotion to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the mother church: yet who is ſo ſimple or weake ſighted, but that through theſe colours, hee may and doth diſcerne God &amp; his ſonne Chriſt blaſphemouſly robbed of that which is their right, man to be occaſioned to ſwell with a conceyt of his owne ability: and that the final marke, that all this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vnto, is, by the ſelling of other folkes ouerplus merits and ſatisfactions vnder, and in the names of pardons, to enrich the Pope and his Prieſts, and by the reſt to ſet vp themſelues in the very ſeat of Antichriſt? They pretend the glory of Chriſt, and of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the doctrine of the ſupremacy: but it is the feeding of their owne pompous &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous ambition, that in trueth they ſeeke in it. In their ſwarmes of Monkeries &amp; Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries they pretend wilfull pouerty, and an vtter forſaking of the
<pb facs="tcp:18269:43"/> world, and yet all the world ſeeth, that to maintaine themſelues therein in idlenes, belly-cheare, and al kinde of worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſure, they had houſes like Princes, and reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nues &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces, like great Lordes of the worlde. They haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they vvould haue Emperours and Kinges in no caſe to giue Biſhoprickes and benefices, to preuent Simony: whereas their practiſe hath made it cleare, that their Popes haue taken that into their owne hands, but to make the clergy more to ſtand at their deuotion, and leſſe at their Princes, and that they &amp; theirs might vſe that occupation and trade of Simony, as moſt proper vnto themſelues. They pretende charity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion in their pardons and indulgences, deuotion and care to relieue ſoules by their maſſes, dirges, and trentals, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to fray me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne by their doctrine of Purgatory: but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeth, that it is onely money, or money worth, that hereby they fiſh for. The vnity of the church is pretended, when they ſeeke to eſtabliſh moſt their owne tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny: the honour and glory of the church (they ſay) they ſeeke, when it is moſt plaine, that it is onely their ovvne glory and honour they care for. In the maintenaunce of their doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, they vvould ſeeme marueilous deuout and religious in vrging of the letter, and in captiuing their ovvne ſences and reaſon thereunto, whereas indeede that courſe they take, that ſo their Prieſtes may grovve to honour and vvealth, vvhiles thereby the people are made beleeue, that they can make and offer their redeemer, for the ſaluation of quicke and deade. Deuotion to the Saints they pretend in teaching, that they are to bee prayed vnto and vvorſhipped, but therein their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is like vnto <hi>Demetrius</hi> his for <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> for if it were not for the gaynes they get by offerings vnto their ſhrynes, they vvould not bee ſo hoate therein. Their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of penaunce caries a ſhevv of mortification, but it is but thereby to triumph ouer the people at their pleaſures, and in the ende to make a gaine by changing their penaunce, or by making them to beleeue, that they vvill relieue them by their prayers, pardons, and maſſes. To conclude, I dare bee bolde to ſay, that there is neuer a proper point of popery, but the practiſe and profeſsion of it would quickly grow very cold, if that the maintenance thereof made not, either directly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
<pb facs="tcp:18269:44"/> their wordly credit with their followers, or their lucre and commodity. And therefore thou maieſt ſee euen by this (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they bragge of their Church and Religion) that euen for theſe three reaſons, they, both of euery wiſe ſtate, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo of thy ſelfe (Chriſtian Reader) ought to be ſhunned and auoided. Theſe things then, that I haue ſaied, well conſidered and remembred, I will now no longer detaine thee from taking a view of that, which (this notwithſtanding) <hi>Albine</hi> hath write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either in the defence of this his Religion, or to the diſgrace of ours: requeſting onely this at thy hands, that as thou goeſt, thou wouldeſt take the paines without partiality, to reade and confer that, which I haue writen to anſwere him withall, Chapter by Chapter with his booke. And thus hoping that thou wilt doe, I commend thee and thy ſtudy therein, to the direction and good protection of God, &amp; my ſelfe vnto thy harty praiers vnto him, in my behalfe.</p>

In reciting thus his words, you wilfully alter them, and frame his argument otherwiſe, then he made it. For he ſaied not (you your ſelfe being witnes in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe his words before) ſeeing that without being called yee take it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, but ſeing of their own boldnes (ſaith he, ſpeaking of you) they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in hand (hauing therein relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it ſelfe) which if you cannot proue (as you neuer ſhal) to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God, it muſt needs follow, not only, that it is not of God, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue taken it in hand of your owne boldnes, as he ſaieth, &amp; ſo by moſt neceſſary conſequent, your calling ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be of God.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18269:48"/> it ſelfe. For he was not ſo ſimple (I warrant you) but he knew as wel as you, that many haue, doe and wil hereafter intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vpon an office of Gods owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and that, notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their lacke of lawful calling thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, the office yet remaineth holy, lawful and good. And therefore, he moſt plainly laboureth, to proue your popiſh calling to your Prieſthoode vnlawful, whatſoeuer you make of your ordinary calling thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, becauſe the Prieſthoode it ſelfe is not of God, &amp; therfore ſuch a thing, as you haue taken in hand of your owne heads, what ordinary calling ſoeuer by man you haue thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to.

For if the office it ſelfe be not of God, but a plant, which the heauenly father hath not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18269:48"/> planted, then howſoeuer you come vnto it, your calling cannot bee of God. A vaine thing therefore is it in you, here or any where els, to ſpend words and time to ſhew, how you attaine your Prieſthood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not anie where firſt proued, the Prieſthood it ſelfe to be of God. That is the thing, that <hi>Caluin</hi> telleth you you muſt ſhew, or els you muſt confeſſe your calling is not of God, ſeing it is but to an office, of your owne boldnes deuiſed and taken in hand. And yet this being a thing, which (to iuſtifie your calling) it ſtood you vpon moſt, &amp; in the beſt maner you could, to haue proued, yea without the profe wherof, all that euer you haue ſaied, or can ſay of neuer ſo ordinarie a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereunto, is merelie vaine &amp; friuolous: yet you ſaie, you will not meddle with it here at this time, but you put it of to another place, not once finding time &amp; place in this your diſcourſe to ſpeake a word of it againe. Wherein at the firſt entrance, in the eies of the wiſe, you haue giuen your Prieſthood a greater wound, then al that you haue ſaied, concerning the lawfulnes of your vocation thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, can euer heale vp againe. For this thing being the moſt pertinent, &amp; material thing, that could be (your drift and purpoſe in this diſcourſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) for you to haue laboured about, as about the ſoule of your cauſe, to giue al the reſt life: how could you perſwade your ſelfe, but that in thus ſhifting of this, though ſo thruſt vpon you by your owne ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Caluins</hi> words, but that euerie one would ſtraight iudge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you did it not, becauſe you had no will to haue proued it, but becauſe you feared, that your ſkil would not ſerue you ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially to doe it? And therefore in pollicy you thought it more wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, thus to paſſe it ouer, as though you could ſaie enough thereof if you liſt, then by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into it, to lay open your weakenes to your frends, in ſo great a matter, at your firſt entrance into your booke.</p>
                  <p>Howſoeuer you haue thought it the ſafeſt waie in this place, to ſay nothing hereof, &amp; for ſauing your credit to make ſhew, as though you would ſay enough in ſome other: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean time, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, the nature of your popiſh Prieſthood conſidered, I confidentlie aduouch, that neither you, nor all you togither, can euer proue indeede, that it is of God. For the Scripture teacheth vs, that Chriſt hath an euerlaſting Prieſthood, and that he executed that office here, and doth ſtil there, where he is, for his Church ſo perfectlie, that he hath this prerogatiue, that he needeth no ſucceſſors to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue his office, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſts of <hi>Aaron</hi> had, nor anie other either to offer any new, or to iterate that ſacrifice, which he offred himſelfe for the ſaluation of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18269:49"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he hath offred one ſo perfect, &amp; ſo perfectly once for al: <hi>He.</hi> 7.23.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which prerogatiues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſing Prieſthoode rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth him of, firſt, in that they will bee his ſucceſſours, in the office of Prieſthoode: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that they take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to offer him again in ſacrifice to his father, for the ſinnes (as they ſay) both of the quick &amp; dead: &amp; moſt blaſphemouſly make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, in their offering him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his father, mediators betwixt him and his father, praying him (as it appeareth in there maſſe-book) that he would fauourably looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and receiue thoſe hoaſts, which they there offer vnto him, for the ſoules of ſuch and ſuch. <hi>Ex miſsâ pro defunctis, ex ſecretis.</hi> Werefore, I dare be bolde to ſay, that ſo far of is it, that their Prieſthoode is of Gods ordinaunce, that moſt certainly it is of Sathans owne deuiſing, and is moſt iniurious to the death and paſſion of Chriſt, and therefore Antichriſtian. Howbeit, ſeeing you haue left <hi>Caluins</hi> aſſertion, that it is not of God; ſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any refutation, and ſo are contented (vntil you better aduiſe your ſelfe, what to ſay againſt it, to let it ſtand ſtill) in the meane ſeaſon to render vs account, of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto it, vpon condition, that wee will make ready our papers, when you haue anſwered vs, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you, how we come by our Miniſtery: I am content to accept of this your condition, and ſo to heare firſt, what you can ſay, for the iuſtifying of your vocation, and after when and where you cal for it, to yeeld you an account of ours. But then in the meane time I muſt put you in minde, and pray the gentle reader to marke it, that for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing you haue ſaied yet, <hi>Caluins</hi> aſſertion againſt your office of Prieſthoode it ſelfe, that it is not of God, ſtandeth in full force.</p>
                  <p>You write, that you are called to this eſtate according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, that is (ſay you) by the right ſucceſſion of Biſhops &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of one catholique faith, deriued from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to our daies, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interruption of it vniuerſally. This you ſay indeede, but what haue you either here, or els where in this your notable diſcourſe (for ſo either you or your frends cal it) brought vs to proue this? you cite here <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. &amp; a place out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is there <hi>Cap.</hi> 62.6. (though in your booke it be quoted <hi>Sap.</hi> 61.) but neither any of theſe, nor al theſe togither do proue your ſaying to be tru. For taking the places in your own ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things therby proued are only theſe, firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the tru Catholick faith hath alwaies ſo ſhined, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light at al times in one place or other to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within the houſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the true Catholick Church &amp; to ſuch as be neare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18269:49"/> thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to and within the ſight thereof: and that Chriſt wil haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually euen vntill his ſecond comming, and vntill his Church bee growen to her ful perfection, his trueth continued in his Church, by faythfull Paſtours and Miniſters: and to this ende ſerueth alſo (in your opinion) your ſimilitude taken from a materiall building, which cannot be perfected without continuance of workemen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it bee done: which yet caryeth with it a diſſimilitude, euen in the thing wherein you reſemble it vnto the Church. For we ſee by daily experience, that in material buildings, if they be great, there are often tymes great and many interruptions, and ceaſings of the workemen, and yet in the ende the building well enough prefected. But bee it that theſe places proue theſe things, and that your vnapt ſimilitude hath no vnfitnes in it, what is all this to the purpoſe, doth it hereupon follow, that you come to your offices of Prieſts &amp; Biſhops as you haue ſaied? Becauſe Chriſt hath alwaies &amp; will to the ende preſerue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the light of his trueth, by the faithful miniſtery of ſome in his church (which is a thing which we alwaies haue conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; firmely beleeued to be true, becauſe he hath had, hath, and wil euer vnto the ende haue, a holy catholicke Church, againſt which the gates of hel neither hath at any time, doeth, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall, vniuerſally preuaile) ſhall it hereupon follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Prieſts &amp; Biſhops are the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom Chriſt hath alwaies and yet doth vſe to this ende? or that amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there hath alwaies beene the right ſucceſsion in one Catholicke faith? Their is none ſo ſimple, but he may eaſily ſee, that there is no neceſſary coherence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this antecedent and conſequent. For Chriſt might haue, and indeede hath had (as I ſhew after in my fourth chapter) by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually from time to time, he hath both continued his Church and his trueth therein, though your Biſhops &amp; Prieſts haue a long time ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues his moſt deadly Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies, in oppoſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with main &amp; might againſt both his Church &amp; truth. The matter you haue vndertaken to ſhew vs is, by what right you exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your miniſtery, or how you were called to that eſtate: for that, as a thing more eaſy, you rather haue choſen to doe, then to proue your office of Prieſthood it ſelfe to be of God, though indeede this be the more material point, &amp; which you ſhould rather haue taken vpon you to proue: but that it ſeemeth, like a prudent man, you tendered more your owne credit, which you foreſaw, was like to take a foile, if you ſhould haue attempted to doe this, which by no colour or ſhew of

You therefore, like a wilie and ſubtle fox, thought it no good pollicie, this way to ſeeke to iuſtifie your calling or maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to your prelacies, &amp; yet rather then you would ſeeme to be able to ſay no more for your maner of comming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then for the offices themſelues you were diſpoſed, you thought it good, thus brauely and braggingly to ſet a face vpon it in theſe words, as though you could ſaie enough: and that makes your fault the greater. You haue no ſooner vttered this your bare and bold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, which were ſomewhat, if you could throughlie proue it, but

For though we graunt you (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies we do moſt willingly) that the Church of Chriſt hath alwaies had in her from her firſt natiuitie, and ſhall haue vnto the ende, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely in all ages in one place or other, ſuch as haue ſhewed the trueth faithfully vnto others, as haue ſhined as lights in their daies ſet vpon a candleſticke, and as haue painefully laboured and ſhall ſtill, to gather together the Saints, to bring them to vnity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Chriſt: yet neither doeth it follow, that theſe haue bene ſo viſible, apparent &amp; glorious in the eies of al men, &amp; that they haue ſo orderly ſucceeded one another, and had their ordination one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one and ſelfeſame place, and after one and ſelfeſame maner, nor that hereupon it ſhould follow, that this hauing bene in any ſort that then by and by it muſt be granted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yours haue entred the ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narie way, that they are right Biſhops and Paſtors, haue had right ſucceſſion alwaies one to an other, and haue alſo, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thing of al, had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out interruption alwaies the ſound catholicke faith continued amongſt them.

And this the Lord hath had, hath and euer wil haue, though your ordinary waie of comming to your places, though your Biſhops and Paſtors, your perſonal and locall, viſible and glorious ſucceſſion, and your ſuppoſed Catholicke truth had neuer beene ſeene or heard of in the world. Yea far more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and gloriouſlie ſhould we haue ſeene the trueth hereof, if this ordinary waie of yours, theſe Biſhops and Prieſtes of yours, this ſucceſſion and counterfeyght trueth of yours, had not in the

But I cannot be perſwaded, that ſuch was your owne ſimplicity, as once to imagine, that the fift of <hi>Mathew, Epheſ.</hi> 4, <hi>Eſaie.</hi> 62. or any other proofe that you vſe to that ende, did ſerue at all to proue your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce to haue bene as you ſaied: I am therefore flat of this minde, and ſo muſt euery man of any wit and diſcretion be (vnleſſe you will giue vs leaue to thinke, that you had neither of both in thus reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) that this was your Romiſh and Popiſh cunning herein, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your ſelfe vnable to proue any of theſe foure points, that your entrance is by the ordinary waie, that your Biſhops and Prieſts are right Biſhops and Prieſts, that you haue had from the Apoſtles right ſucceſſion, and that alſo now and alwaies you haue beene in poſſeſſion of the Catholick trueth: you thought it good, confidently, as though their were no controuerſie to be made with you about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe, to aduouch, that you had all theſe to iuſtifie your maner of comming to your offices. And ſo perſwading your ſelfe that you ſhould meete with ſuch franke and liberall Readers, as would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vpon this your bolde begging, graunt you all theſe foure for an almes, taking them for giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as ſure as though you had them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your beggers budget, euen for and at the very firſt aſking, you goe on as you doe, ſuppoſing that your Reader is already wonne to this, to imagine that all and euery place of ſcripture that ſpeakes of right Biſhops and paſtours, and of their lawful calling &amp; ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one another fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age in the trueth, muſt needes be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of yours.

Likewiſe, though for the auoiding of braules &amp; contentions, in the election of the Roman Prelates, <hi>Leo</hi> the 8. gaue abſolute authority to the Emperour, to chuſe the Pope, about the yeare 994. &amp; in <hi>Clement</hi> the 2. time, vpon that conſideration, the Romans themſelues alſo gaue ouer their right therein vnto him, inſomuch that beſides others, <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth and <hi>Victor</hi> the ſecond, had the place by his abſolute authority: yet, euen whiles this ſtoode as the ordinary waie agreed vpon, manie entered otherwiſe. To bee briefe, I dare confidentlie ſet it downe, for I am able to proue it by their owne ſtorie writers, how
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18269:57"/> often ſoeuer they haue varied and altered their ordinarie way of en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tering vnto that place, ſometimes by admitting the Emperours conſent thereunto, ſometimes by ſhutting it out quite, ſometime by giuing him his due right, and ſometime more and ſometime leſſe, or howſoeuer: in like ſort they haue varied both as touching the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the people that ſhould haue to deale therein, wherein they haue had as many diuerſities as about the former, or finally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer concerning other circumſtances of their election, they haue thought good to adde or detract from the ordinary way before in force, they haue neither long continued anie one ordinary waie, neither during the time of the continuance thereof, haue they followed inviolably that waie. And as it hath beene with that chiefe Sea of theirs, ſo hath it bene with other inferiour places, ſo that no conſtancie hath beene in anie of their ordinarie waies of entrance, nor yet anie due care either carefully to obſerue the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ſcripture, the canons of the Church, or their owne decrees made for that purpoſe. In their late councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> by ſundry canons and Chapters therein ſet downe, it appeares, that they there aſſembled, conſidering what horrible abuſes there had beene in the election and ordination of vnfit Biſhops and Prieſts amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought it moſt needeful (to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the like for the time to come) to deuiſe &amp; to enact ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry holeſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e canons, to breed a learned preaching miniſtrie, and to procure an election and ordination thence forth for them, as free from corruption, as in their wiſedomes they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue: but yet who knows not, but that thoſe cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue ſince bine and yet are, as careleſly lookt vnto, and herein kept amongſt them, as though they had neuer beene made. Wherefore, to conclude this point, let <hi>Albine</hi> and neuer ſo many more of them, brag that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the ordinary way, vnles thereby he meane a way that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is naught and corrupt, he ſpeaketh more then euer he can proue, and ſo therein hath ſaied nothing to proue the comming of their Biſhops and Prieſts vnto their places to be lawfull and good.</p>
                  <p>And yet if we will beleeue him, their Biſhops and Prieſts are right Biſhops and Prieſts, but if it be true, as it muſt needes bee, that they can not be ſo, who neither haue a lawfull way of entraunce to their offices, nor yet their offices are themſelues of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then it is apparant euen by that which I haue ſaied already, that neither their Biſhops nor Prieſtes are right Biſhops nor Prieſts. Their Biſhops from the higheſt to the loweſt, by their v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18269:57"/> and practiſe chalenge and take vnto themſelues, an office of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother eſſence and nature, then the office that Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue left and preſcribed to true Biſhops, and ſo likewiſe is it with their Prieſts. For one vniuerſall and head Biſhop o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all others (ſuch as they take their Pope to be) Chriſt neuer ordeined, for he made all his Apoſtles by giuing them all equall, one and ſelfeſame commiſſion, his officers equallie to beare for their times the generall and vniuerſall care of ouerſight, ruling, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and directing his Church; and to bring it to full perfection, aſcending into heauen, when he was diſpoſed this waie in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church officers vpon his Church, by the miniſtery of his word and ſacraments, to conſummate it vnto the ende, beſides theſe, as inferiour miniſters, hee gaue onely, as you may read <hi>Epheſians</hi> the fourth, Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts, Prophets, Paſtours &amp; teachers, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Popes, Cardinals, nor Maſſe-prieſts, are once reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred. The matter wherein the full execution of the off ce of al the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth, that Chriſt hath left vnto his Church, is, duely &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feede Gods people committed vnto them, with heauenly foode, by painefull and diligent preaching vnto them the word of God, and miniſtring vnto them the ſacraments, and rightly and oderly to gouerne the Churches of Chriſt, by the adminiſtration of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall order and diſcipline, which are things, that the greateſt and fatteſt in your Romiſh Synagog, thinke themſelues little or no whit at all bound vnto. Theſe things are too baſe matters for your Popes to be occupied about, their office conſiſts, and therefore they accordingly muſt buſie themſelues in other matters: as namely, in making and marring, in ſetting vp &amp; putting downe ſeculer Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they call them, in ſtudying by all meanes faire and foule, to mainetaine and to enlarge their authority and patrimony, &amp; in deuiſing by a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d waies, though neuer ſo couetouſly, tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nouſly &amp; inſatiably, to gather together infinite ſums of money, to buy or to winne by force of armes, great principalities for their baſtards, nephews and neeces, to ſpend in the perſecuting &amp; ſubduing better Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to build ſumptuous pallaces, banquetting houſes, &amp; temples to ſhroud idolatry &amp; idols in, coſtly beutified, the better to intice men for their further aduantage, to commit ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whoardome with them. In and about theſe things, your Popes now, theſe many 100. yeares haue ſpent their wits, &amp; all theſe parts of the world, and all Croniclers of any credit, can and wil te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18269:58"/> If they haue any leaſure from theſe affaires, then they muſt ſhewe themſelues not to haue beene idle and fruitleſſe in deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome newe ceremonie, in adding ſome patch or other to their Church ſeruice, in proclaiming the croſſe againſt the <hi>Turke,</hi> for the recouery of the holy land, in publiſhing ſome Iubile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, in ſetting vp ſome new order of Religious men, for the better ſupport of their kingdome, or at leaſt in plotting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing ſome conſpiracy or trecherous deuiſe, to ſupplant and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Chriſtian Prince, that hath drawen or is like to draw his people from their Antichriſtian Religion. And your other Biſhops occupation lieth moſt in bleſſing with their fingers, in conſecrating of their vnholy holie Chriſme, in chriſtening of belles and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in ordering vnorderlie and contrary to their owne cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of an idolatrous and new found ſort of Prieſts, &amp; in running vp &amp; downe fondly and ſuperſtitiouſly, to miniſter the ſacrament, as they count it, of confirmation: ſcarſe the tythe of them euer had either ſkill or will to preach. And as for your Cardinals, as they are of an order but of a late deuiſe, ſo by their behauiour we can not iudge their office to lie in any thing elſe, but to ſerue the Popes turne, for the better ſetting forth of his magnificence at home, and to bee his agents in forraine kingdomes, the eaſelier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue his purpoſes their. They are and haue beene a long time (their firſt natiuity conſidered) notable fellowes to hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſtewes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to deuoure and to conſume, in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, vanity and impiety, all the Biſhopricks and benefices that they could heape together, without any care for the good of the people: and the vſe of them hath beene, to brawle and to breede ſciſmes in chooſing of Popes, and to ſtur al coales, and to moue euery ſtone, as faſt as they could one after another, to thruſt into that place. Now to come to your ordinary Prieſtes, though the matter of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miniſtring of ſacraments, eſpeciallie was poſted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto them, and vnto Friers, yet either were they not able to doe it, which was the condition of moſt of them; or elſe if they did it, in ſteade of feeding the people with the milke of Gods word, which onelie Saint <hi>Peter</hi> warrants to bee without deceit 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. they fed them, with vaine dreames, fanſies, tales and traditions of men. For theſe onely are the grounds of that which is properly now the Romiſh Religion. And in very deede, when they were ordered, their eſpeciall buſineſſe appointed for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18269:58"/> them was, to ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead, which is a thing not onely beſide the office of anie true miniſter of Chriſt, but alſo directly contrarie, both to their office, and Chriſts alſo. For they by warrant expreſſely from the canonicall ſcriptures are to teach their people, that Chriſt himſelfe in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon once for all, when hee dyed for the redemption of man, offered the ſacrifice that for both quicke and deade ſoly and wholy, fully and effectually muſt ſerue the turne for euer, and that in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this propitiatory ſacrifice, he is an euerlaſting Prieſt, and may haue no ſucceſſour, either to offer another ſacrifice, as though this were not ſufficient; or to offer this againe, as though hee had not himſelfe offered it well enough.

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the right vſe thereof, thereby ſhould bee offered vnto man the bodie broken and bloud ſhed of Chriſt, for him to bee fed on, and receiued by him to ſaluation: by their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and intention herein, they offer theſe thinges to God the father. Further, if wee conſider their reading vnto the people, all in an vnknowen tongue, their praying to Saints and Angels, their praying for the dead, their blaſphemous i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, that they by breathing a ſet number of wordes vpon a wafer cake, make it very Chriſt, and other their ſuperſtitious and magicall incatations and coniurations of water, oyle, ſalt, palmes and other creatures, theſe beeing ſo directly contrary to the word of God as they bee: whatſoeuer here <hi>Albine</hi> hath ſayed of them, wee may moſt iuſtlie and truely aduoutch them to bee right Prieſtes of Antichriſt, and conſequentlie no right Prieſtes of Chriſt. But ſeeing hee will needes ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely and generallie pronounce his ſentence, That their Biſhops and Prieſtes bee right Biſhops and Prieſts, to leaue theſe generall obiections and reaſons againſt them, and to come to ſome particuler examples: firſt I would faine knowe of him, whereas there haue beene a twenty three ſciſmes at leaſt in the Papall ſee, ſometime two, ſometime three, ſometime foure, all at once contending that they were right Popes, which of theſe was alwaies hee, that for the time was to be accounted the right Biſhop? And if neuer but one of them, yea ſometimes none of them were right, and therefore they were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18269:59"/> driuen to depoſe and ſuppreſſe them, and to ſet vp a newe, they all during their times hauing had manie followers, and many were made Biſhops and Prieſts by them, and ſo ſucceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This nutte will trouble the whole Church of Rome to cracke. But to deale plainely and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what can he or any of them, vnleſſe they be diſpoſed to be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gling by a cloud of witneſſes, ſay for <hi>Ioan</hi> the eighth, that in the ende proued her ſelfe, openly in a ſolemne proceſſion, to bee a harlot by her fruitfulnes; for <hi>Chriſtopher, Sergius, Laudo, Iohn</hi> the <hi>11.12. &amp; 13.</hi> all Popes in a rowe, and yet eſpeciallie aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto, and kept in that dignity, by their concubines and harlots; for <hi>Silueſter</hi> the ſecond, and a number of his ſucceſſours, who were promoted by Nicromancy and poiſoning their predeceſſours; or for <hi>Hildebrand</hi> after called <hi>Gregorie 7.</hi> who the ſame euening that his predeceſſour was dead, thruſt into the place, not one Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall ſubſcribing to his election, rather euen by force then by any meanes elſe? <hi>Boniface</hi> the eightth got the place by coſening <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> his predeceſſour, by the ſound of a voice through a tronke through the wall of his chamber: <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth was choſen Pope by the Cardinalles at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet, as I ſaied before, when they choſe him hee was but twentie yeares olde, he could neither write, nor ſing, nor vnderſtand his latin tongue: <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar de Coſſa</hi> Cardinall, through feare at <hi>Bononia</hi> draue the Cardinals to refer the nomination of the Pope, whom there they were about to chuſe, to himſelfe, who by and by choſe and ſet vp himſelfe. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, builded a famous ſtewes at <hi>Rome</hi> of both kindes (as <hi>Agryppa</hi> writeth of him) and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Weſſelus Groningenſis,</hi> hee graunted an indulgence to the family of S. <hi>Lucia,</hi> that for the three hoate monethes in the yeare, they might vſe the ſinne not to be named.

And the rather, that which in this reſpect is writen of him ſhould ſeeme to be true, becauſe in his time, there was one <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mutius</hi> ſet vp, publickely in bookes to defende certaine filthie and lothſome amarous verſes, writen by one <hi>Camillus Oliuus,</hi> companion to the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to one <hi>Hanibal Coliuus:</hi> &amp; that in his time <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes Caſa</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Beneuentum,</hi> Deane of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicke, and the Popes Legate in the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Venis,</hi> wrote in the commendation of that filthy fact of <hi>Petrus Aloyſius Paulus 3.</hi> his ſonne, with <hi>Coſmus Cherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fane,</hi> and that with the applauſe and liking of that time. Now what? Will <hi>Albine</hi> ſay, for all theſe things, that theſe were right Popes, Biſhops and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals? right and ſeemely they maie be, to ſerue the whoar of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> otherwiſe, ſuch can neuer be right Biſhops and Prieſts to ſerue the Lord Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>But if neither that which he hath ſaied, concerning their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to their places, by the ordinary way, nor this vaunt of his, that their Biſhops and Prieſts be right Biſhops and Prieſts, can doe him any good: yet it may be, he hopeth ſome credit will growe vnto them, in that he hath ſaied, they haue their places vy right ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Indeede ſucceſſion and the deriuation of it without interruption, downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles, eſpecially in their line of Popes, is a thing that ſuch as he brag much of, ſaying, that that they haue, &amp; we haue not, &amp; that therfore their Church &amp; the miniſters thereof, muſt needs be good and lawfull, and ours the plaine contrarie. Howbeit, if we examine this point throughly, we ſhall find, that they haue as weake helpe hence, as from the other, or from any thing elſe. For whither they vnderſtand by right ſucceſſion, ſucceſſion without interruption in place, perſon or office, ſeuerally or iointly togither, neither can their Biſhops and Prieſts, as they are now, truelie ſaie they haue it, nor yet if they could, they being gone as they be, from the ſoule and life of right Apoſtolicke ſucceſſion, namely the Catholicke and Apoſtolicke trueth, are they euer the better. And of the contrarie, though it were neuer ſo true, that we could not deduce vnto our preſent Biſhops and Paſtours downe from the Apoſtles or their times, without interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the line of ſucceſſion, in place, perſon and office; yet we being able to ſhew, as wee are, that we holde one and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18269:60"/> ſelfeſame doctrine with them, that would iuſtify our Church, and miniſters ſufficientlie, notwithſtanding the want of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This is quickly and eaſily ſayed (you will ſaie) but theſe thinges cannot ſo readily bee proued. I graunt, to proue them will coſt the more paines, otherwiſe the proofe is readie and pregnant enough, and that I doubt not, but (if, with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, that which I ſhall write to that ende bee marked) ſhall ere it bee long appeare. I ſay therefore, firſt, that the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſtes, as they are now and haue beene a long time, whatſoeuer they brag, no not their verie Popes (vnto whoſe right ſucceſſion <hi>Stapleton</hi> and others truſt moſt) haue any right ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either to any Apoſtle or Apoſtolick man, in place, perſon or office. For firſt, they can neuer ſoundly proue (the proofes out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſo ſtrong to the contrary, &amp; their proofes out of the ſtories ſo diſagreeing and variable in all circumſtances) that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, whoſe ſucceſſours their Popes claime to be, and from whom al other Biſhops and Prieſts amongſt them, haue their vocations and authority deriued, was either euer at <hi>Rome,</hi> or being there, that, hauing laied aſide his Apoſtleſhip, which was the greater and higher office, he ſate there as Biſhop. Secondly, vnto this day they cannot agree, of the order of ſucceeding one another betwixt <hi>Linus, Cletus, Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; Anaclet. Vrſpergenſis</hi> in the life of <hi>Claudius,</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably &amp; at large ſet out, both the difference of opinions in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo the vncertainty of the trueth. Thirdly, none of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reading, can be ſo ignorant in the ſtories of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but he knowes, that they haue not ſucceeded one another, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles to this day w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies, neither in place, perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor office. For beſids that ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry times, many Popes for ſome ſhort time haue ſate from <hi>Rome,</hi> it is notoriouſly knowen, that <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the <hi>5.</hi> about the yeare <hi>1305.</hi> tranſlated the Popes ſee from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Auinion,</hi> where it continued aboue <hi>70.</hi> years. And as for immediate &amp; orderly ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perſons amongſt them, how is it poſſible truely &amp; certainly to define &amp; ſet downe that, ſeing that ſee hath not onely ſtoode vacant, daies, weekes, monethes, and years, ſomtimes <hi>2.</hi> ſometimes more, but alſo there hath bene at once ſo often, not only <hi>2.</hi> but often <hi>3.</hi> &amp; ſometime more, euery one ſtriuing with his fauorers to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be the right Pope. And laſtly, by that which I haue ſaid before of the nature of their offices of Popes Cardinalles, Biſhoppes &amp; Prieſtes, their practiſe prouing daily my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18269:60"/> words therein to be moſt true, how dare any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath any feare of God, once ſay or think, that they in their offices haue any affinity with the Apoſtles, or any Apoſtolicke man? Light &amp; darknes are not more differing the one from the other, then the offices of Apoſtles, Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts, Prophets, Paſtours &amp; Doctours in the ancient primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue &amp; Apoſtolick Church, differeth from theſe offices of theirs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whereas I ſayed, though yet they could, which now you ſee they cannot, truely ſay, that they ſucceed the Apoſtles &amp; Apoſtolicke men in place, perſon and office, yet they were neuer the nearer: my reaſons thereof are theſe. Firſt, I finde, that wicked people &amp; wicked Prieſts in the ſcriptures, often haue had this kinde of ſucceſſion, to pleade for themſelues, againſt the true Prophets and againſt Chriſt himſelfe, as you may ſee <hi>Ierem. 7. verſ. 4. &amp; cap. 8. verſ. 8. Iohn. 8. v. 44. Vriah</hi> the Prieſt in King <hi>Ahaz</hi> time, had this ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and yet he to pleaſe that Idolatrous king, ſet vp, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the commandement of the Lord, an altar according to the patterne that the King had ſent him, of one that hee had ſeene at <hi>Damaſcus, 2. King. 16.10.11.</hi> The high Prieſts, that withſtoode alwaies Chriſt &amp; his doctrine, and in the ende crucified him, had this kinde of ſuceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; yet none of theſe or their doings were any thing the more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable for this. Againe though <hi>Stapleton lib. 13. doctrinalium principioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſes, that the Greekes haue beene ſciſmatiques and heretiques this <hi>500.</hi> yeares, yet he &amp; all the ſort of them of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding know, that not they only, but alſo the Patriarches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Biſhops of ſundry other famous Churches in the world, all which likewiſe, they holde, bee ſciſmatiques and heretiques, can &amp; doe make as great ſhew of this kinde of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the countenancing of their miniſtery and Churches, as they themſelues, for they knowe, that the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> doeth deduce his locall and perſonall ſucceſſion from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> the Apoſtle; &amp; that the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> now ſitting at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> doeth likewiſe his from <hi>Peter,</hi> which he may doe more certainly, then the Popes when they ſate at <hi>Auinion</hi> could, for it is euident <hi>Gal. 2. ver. 11.</hi> euen by the ſcripture it ſelfe, that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp; ſo is it not that he was at <hi>Rome.</hi> In like maner, they knowe that the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> now holding his ſeate at <hi>Alcairum,</hi> deriues his, from the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Marke.</hi> And ignorant they are not, that the Arrians, preuailing as they did, and in the ende hauing got the moſt ſeats of Biſhops to be furniſhed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18269:61"/> with men of their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable opinion, that they for that time were able to holde this plea aſwell as themſelues, and yet I am ſure they will grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that none of theſe were therfore, or are therfore to be allowed &amp; iuſtified. They will ſay, I am ſure (for ſo I finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plainly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in their writings, yea euen <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> himſelfe afterward <hi>Cap. 7.</hi>) that though theſe all can and doe plead ſucceſſion in place, perſon and office, that yet it cannot iuſtifie them, becauſe not onelie they haue helde, ſome of them, deteſtable hereſies, but preſently alſo doe ſtill. Indeede I muſt needs confeſſe, that I read, that <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Sergius</hi> abrupted the line of right ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by their hereſies at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> that <hi>Paulus Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did the like at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Petrus Mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> did likewiſe at <hi>Alexanderia.</hi> And I cannot deny, but that I finde all theſe and the Churches vnder them ſtill charged, to holde errours and hereſies, but this then withall I infer, the more true that it is, and hath beene thus with them, the more euident it is, of what ſmall acount this perſonall and locall ſucceſſion is of it ſelfe, either to giue credit to Biſhops and Paſtours, or their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that can plead that. And this further I adde, if theſe be ſufficient cauſes to make their alleadged ſucceſſion to be of no valew, then there is as great cauſe, why ſucceſſion bragged on ſo much by the Romaniſts, ſhould be reiected, as a thing not worth the naming. For not onely in inferiour places of Biſhops and Prieſtes (which is a thing that they will not ſtriue with vs about) it is ſo manifeſt, that there haue beene many heretiques amongſt them; but alſo euen in their line of Popes (who, as ſome of them hold, cannot erre) there haue bene ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry heretiques alſo. For <hi>Tertullian contra Praxeam,</hi> writeth of a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that did allow of the Propheſies of <hi>Montanus,</hi> &amp;, as he ſaieth, therefore ſent letters of communion to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Phrigia</hi> thereabout. And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his epiſtle <hi>ad ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litariam vitam agentes,</hi> and ſo alſo <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the life of <hi>Liberius,</hi> and <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de eccleſiaſticis ſcriptoribus</hi> teſtifie, that Pope <hi>Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was drawen in the ende to ſubſcribe to <hi>Arianiſme.</hi> And <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> died an heretique, as it is to be ſeene in the firſt general councel, <hi>Act. 12. &amp; 13. &amp;c. Liberatus</hi> alſo <hi>Breuiarii Cap. 22.</hi> witneſſeth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in ſecret fauoured heretiques. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the ſecond, fell into a condemned hereſie, as we read <hi>Diſt. 19. Cap. Anaſtaſius:</hi> and therefore would haue reſtored <hi>Accatius</hi> a condemned heretique. And yet I ſay nothing of Pope <hi>Iohn 23.</hi> condemned for an heretique by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18269:61"/> the councell of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance</hi> &amp; the ſchole of <hi>Paris,</hi> for denying in effect the immortality of the ſoule. Yea the euidence of the trueth in this point is ſo open and ſtrong, that it hath cauſed their owne frends to condemne them of groſſe flattery, that holde, that Popes haue not and cannot fall into hereſie; as any man may ſee that will read <hi>Alphonſus contra haereſes lib. 1. Cap. 2. &amp; 4. Lyra</hi> vpon the <hi>16</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> and the third Synodall Epiſtle of the councell of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill.</hi> And that the Romiſh Church doeth now holde as groſſe and palpable errours and hereſies, as they charge theſe withall, if I proue not ere I haue done with <hi>Albine,</hi> I will neuer craue credit either to our miniſters, or to our Churches and cauſe. Wherfore to leaue the proofe of this to his place or places (to goe on with that which I haue vndertooke to proue againſt them, concerning this their brag of right ſucceſſion) whereas thirdly I ſaied, that though we were not able to deduce or deriue downe from the Apoſtles w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, any locall and perſonall ſucceſſion vnto our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that now bee, yet as long as ours teach, and our people embrace the ſame doctrine that they taught, wee are well enough, whatſoeuer they ſay to the contrary: that reſteth onely now in this caſe to be proued. But before I come to the proofe of this, leaſt in this my aſſertion I be miſtaken, I would firſt, that it were marked, that I ſpeake but by way of ſuppoſition, that is, if we were not able to ſet downe a continued line, downe from them to vs without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interruption, for in the <hi>4. Chapter</hi> following, I hope, I ſhall ſet downe ſuch a deſcent of our Church from them to vs, as whereby it may ſufficiently appeare, that there was neuer age nor time ſince, but our Church and religion hath had her teachers and hearers. Secondly, I would haue it alſo vnderſtoode, that my meaning is, though it were ſo, that wee could not make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall or demonſtration of any ſuch deſcent or ſucceſſion: in that proceſſe of time, diſtance of place, and the force and ſubtlety of our enemies kept vs from knowing their names, perſons and places; that yet for the continuance of the trueth and the Church of Chriſt amongſt men, I conſtantly holde and beleeue, that there hath beene a continuall and vninterrupted ſucceſſion of teachers and embracers of GODS trueth, whereof his Church conſiſtes, euen from the firſt beginning thereof, and ſhall bee to the ende. Onely this is it that thereby I am contented bee inſinuated, that the Churches of Chriſt, if they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18269:62"/> can proue, that they are taught by ſuch miniſters as God doeth raiſe vp vnto them, according vnto his good pleaſure, whither ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or extraordinarily, and that they embrace no other doctrine but that which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught (witnes the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſcriptures) that then, they are to be accounted Apoſtolike and holy Churches of God, and that in ſuch a caſe, eſpecially in and after great perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ruines &amp; long oppreſſions of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they neede not to be daunted nor diſcouraged, neither in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their miniſters and teachers, nor in reſpect of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, though they cannot be able lineally to name the perſons, either by whom their miniſters, downe from the Apoſtles, haue had their vocation deriued vnto them, or elſe by whom euer ſince, that trueth hath beene continued. For howſoeuer in viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of GOD, whiles they ſtande in floriſhing or vnoppreſſed ſtate and condition, by the fury of perſecutours, there is a ſet order and forme viſibly to bee obſerued in the vocation of Church miniſters, in reſpect of which eſtates and times it is eaſie for them that liue therein, or within the knowledge and remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thereof, to make demonſtration of the lyne of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet when in the iuſt iudgement of God, the Churches ſhall bee oppreſſed, as now a long a time they haue beene, vnder the tyranny of Antichriſt, then and after ſuch a time, ſuch a thing growes to many not onely harde, but alſo impoſſible. And in ſuch tymes wee finde, that the Lorde of his wiſedome and power to continue yet his Church, rayſeth vp men, though not by the ordinary way vſed in the former tymes, as after the diſperſion of the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> by meanes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution there, when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, we reade that the Diſciples beeing diſperſed, and namely with them <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon, that hee preached, the Apoſtles not aware thereof, for any thing that appears: ſo vnder <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine, Antonius</hi> the heremite taught at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and vnder <hi>Valens, Aphraates, Flaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> and <hi>Iulianus</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> beeing then but Monkes, who in thoſe dayes were not ſo much as counted amongſt Clarkes, as wee reade in <hi>Nicephorus libro 11. Chap. 15.</hi> Theſe thinges thus premiſed, thereby not onely my meaning ſhall rightly bee conceiued, but alſo that which I haue ſaied, in ſome ſort is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confirmed. But my reaſon indeede is, that true and ſounde apoſtolicke doctrine, in the good prouidence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

And becauſe my aduerſary ſeemeth in this point, &amp; otherwiſe to make great reckoning of the teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I will ſtande to their iudgement in this, whither to ſucceede the Apoſtles in doctrine, be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without the other locall and perſonall demonſtrable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and not this without that. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his fourth booke and forty three Chapter, teacheth vs onely to obey thoſe Elders in the Church, which from the Apoſtles with the ſucceſsion of their Biſhopricks, haue receiued <hi>Chariſma veritatis certum ſecundum placitum patris,</hi> that is, the certaine gift of trueth according to the pleaſure of the father; for, as for all other, whatſoeuer they pretend (for he excepteth nothing) he there immediatly ſheweth, that <hi>abſiſtunt a principali ſucceſſione,</hi> that is, they are gone from the principall ſucceſſion, and therefore muſt be ſuſpected. And <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in the very ſame place, <hi>de praeſcriptionibus haereticorum,</hi> quoted by <hi>Albine</hi> after, in his <hi>9.</hi> Chapter, immediatly after the words there cited by him, wherein he calleth for perſonall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hath added theſe, <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fingant tale aliquid haeretici &amp;c.</hi> but let heretiques deuiſe ſome ſuch thing, for after blaſphemy, what is not lawfull for them (ſaieth hee) but though they doe faine ſome ſuch thing, yet it ſhall nothing preuaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For their doctrine compared with the Apoſtolique doctrine, by the diuerſity &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariety thereof, wil pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that it hath neither Apoſtle nor Apoſtolique ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the authour therof. For (ſaith he) as the Apoſtles taught not amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt themſelues contrary things, ſo neither did Apoſtolique men teach contrary things to thoſe that the Apoſtles taught. After this ſort therefore let them be prouoked by thoſe Churches, which though they cannot produce either Apoſtle or Apoſtolique man to bee the founder thereof, in that they were long after planted, as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18269:63"/> there bee, <hi>tamen in eâdem fide conſpirantes, non minùs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicae deputantur pro conſanguinitate doctrinae,</hi> yet they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one faith, are no leſſe to be reputed Apoſtolicke Churches, then they that were planted by the Apoſtles. What can be plainer then this, to ſhewe, that though our Churches could not ſatiſfie his requeſt, in pleading the former ſucceſſion, that yet if they can ſhewe this, that they agree with the Apoſtles in doctrine, that they therefore are far rather Apoſtolicke, then they that can produce the former without this. And though <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>165.</hi> epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and alſo in his fourth Chapter againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi> epiſtle, which they call their foundation, remembred by <hi>Albine cap. 6.</hi> doe there ſeeme to make great reckoning of perſonall ſucceſſion: yet when he had ſhewed of what force that and ſome other reaſons were with him, he preferres trueth indeede warranted by the ſcriptures, before them all. Wherefore, what I haue ſaied, concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their brag of perſonall and locall ſucceſſion, either to iuſtifie theirs, or to diſgrace our Church or miniſtrie, is ſufficientlie proued.</p>
                  <p>But all this labour (will <hi>Albine</hi> ſay) I might haue ſpared, for he ſpake not ſimplie of ſucceſſion, but expreſſely of right ſucceſſion of Biſhops &amp; paſtours; and to ſhew what he ment thereby, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added the continuance of one Catholicke faith deriued from the Apoſtles to our daies, without the interruption of it vniuerſally at anie time. Moreouer, I confeſſe that ſundry times after (ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the trueth in this point with him) that in wordes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that perſonall and locall ſucceſſion, without continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this trueth, is not the thing that he vrgeth, and yet for all this, this that I haue ſaied of this point, is not needleſſe. For beſides that fewe of his opinion, will bee brought to confeſſe thus much, this both in others, and in himſelfe in ſundrie Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, maie be obſerued, that when this confeſſion is made by anie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is wroong fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them much againſt their wils, for their ſhew of proofes run wholy for the magnifying of perſonall ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the marke, whereby true Churches, and the miniſters thereof maie vndoubtedly be diſcerned. Againe, if in this he ſpake as hee thinkes, why doeth he make ſo much adoe, about the perſonall and viſible ſucceſſion of Biſhops and paſtours, and neuer ioines this iſſue with vs, to trie out ſoundly and throughly, whither they or we haue this Catholicke and Apoſtolicke trueth. For herein onely lieth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18269:63"/> all the controuerſie betwixt them and vs, and this determined, the queſtion betwixt vs were quite ended: let them once therefore but proue indeed, that they are in poſſeſſion of this ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d trueth, and that alwaies downe from the Apoſtles they haue continued therein, if we ioyne not ſtreight with them, and repent vs hartely of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them, accurſed be we. Yea, if we cannot proue by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their doctrine, with that which wee are moſt ſure the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught, to be both diuerſe from that, and contrary vnto it (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by their doctrine, as wee doe, that, which is proper to them, and wherein we are againſt them) let vs for euer leeſe our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and cauſe. Now for the decyding and determining of this great &amp; maine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, wee appeale to the canonical ſcriptures, which we knowe are moſt fit and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges herein: whereunto, vnles they will deſerue the name of <hi>lucifugae</hi> (that is, of ſhunners of the light) which for the like cauſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> gaue the heretiques of his time, <hi>de reſurrect. carnis,</hi> they will be contented to bring their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as to the touchſtone. Indeede in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> time, the heretiques (as it appeares in their workes) for the triall of their opinions, fled from this touchſtone, and when they were vrged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they behaued themſelues the likeſt theſe our aduerſaries that euer I ſaw. For <hi>Iraeneus</hi> in his third booke and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtifieth thus of them: <hi>cùm ex Scripturis arguuntur, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſationem conuertuntur ipſarum, quaſi non rectè habeant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſint ex authoritate, &amp; quia variè ſunt dictae, &amp; quia non poſsit ex his inueniri veritas ab his qui neſciunt traditionem:</hi> that is, when they are reproued by the ſcriptures, then they are turned ſtreight into an accuſation of them, as though they were not right, nor were of authority, both becauſe they are ſo ſet downe, as that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably or diuerſly they may be taken, and becauſe by them the trueth cannot be found out by thoſe, that are ignoraunt of tradition. This notwithſtanding, it appeareth both there and elſewhere, that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to this triall. And ſo doeth <hi>Tertullian de reſurrectione carnis, Cap. 3.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Auferantur ab haereticis quae cum aethnicis ſapiunt, vt de ſcripturis ſolis ſuas quaeſtiones fiſtant &amp; ſtare non poſſunt,</hi> that is, let thoſe things be taken from heretiques which they holde with the heathen, that onely by the ſcriptures they may determine their queſtions, and they cannot ſtand. And nothing was more vſuall and familier with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt the heretiques of his time, then to call them, for the triall of the queſtion, both whither
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18269:64"/> he or they were of the true Church, &amp; alſo whither of them had the trueth, to this way of triall by the ſcriptures. And therefore <hi>de v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate eccleſiae, Nolo humanis documentis, ſed diuinis oraculis eccleſiam demonſtrare,</hi> I will not make demonſtration of the Church by the writings of men, but by the diuine oracles, ſaieth he <hi>Cap, 3.</hi> &amp; again, there alſo he further addeth, preſſing the heretiques with whom hee had there to doe: <hi>ſunt libri dominici, quoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati vtri<expan>

But there is nothing ſaied, to proue that they and their ſucceſſion in the truth, ſhould be ſo viſible &amp; apparent, as you dreame of. But to awake you out of this dreame, you muſt heare and vnderſtand, that though it be as certaine, that neither the trueth, nor teachers thereof, hath at any time, or ſhal hereafter vtterly faile, or ceaſe to be in the Church, as it is, that the Church if ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth euer, &amp; neuer quite ceaſeth: yet thereupon it followeth not, that therefore both the trueth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof haue ſo continued a perſonall ſucceſſion one vnto another, or one immediatly after another, and are withal ſo viſible and apparent, that their names and places may ſtraight not onely then, but alwaies after of euery one (as you vpon theſe places would infer) be pointed and painted out. And for the confirmation &amp; proofe hereof, let vs briefely take a view of the ſtate of the Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, as it is ſet downe vnto vs in the holy Scriptures. And in this point, let vs beginne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church, when in reſpect of all the former times it was beſt ſetled, &amp; began to haue the moſt viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence, namely when vnder the conduict, &amp; by the ſeruice of <hi>Ioſua</hi> God had placed it in <hi>Canaan.</hi> After this, though God therein had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed a Prieſthood, &amp; tied it <hi>Leuit. 10.</hi> by his ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; promiſe to the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> &amp; though the Church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had moſt notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Gods preſence, &amp; fauour towards it, <hi>Pſal. 68.2.

And in <hi>Elies</hi> time <hi>(1.

                  <p>But you wil ſay perhaps, that though theſe thinges were thus in the Church, in the time of the olde Teſtament, yet it may not be ſo in the Church now, in the time of the new.

In the meane time, thus much is gained by theſe ſtories of the Church, in the time of the olde teſtament, that this outward clearenes &amp; viſible ſucceſſion, you talke of, is not an inſeparable note of the true Church, for therby we haue ſeene it ſeperated ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times from it.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18269:67"/> which it did, in that there were falſe Apoſtles there that taught men to ſeeke iuſtification partly by faith, &amp; partly by the workes of the law, as it appeareth by the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:</hi> &amp; weigh that he attributeth vnto him ſuch things, as could not be brought to paſſe in that ſpace: &amp; laſtly conſider, that he teacheth, that though he ſhould be detected and fal into a conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Spirit of Gods mouth, yet he ſhould not be fully aboliſhed before Chriſts ſecond comming.

Which they would neuer haue done, if either they or their fauorites had then ſeene a viſible ſucceſſion of Biſhops and paſtours amongſt them, and had knowen their names, and where to haue found them. If wee go on to the time that the <hi>Arrians</hi> moſt floriſhed, wee ſhall read, that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſayed to <hi>Liberius, Quota pars es tu orbis terrarum, qui ſolus facis cum homine ſcelerato,</hi> meaning <hi>Athanaſius, Eccleſiaſt. Hiſt. Theodoreti. lib. 2. cap: 16.</hi> whereby it appeareth, that then the Catholiques that withſtood the <hi>Arrians,</hi> in the ſight of this Emperour, had but a poore viſibility to bragge of. Yea <hi>Piggius,</hi> your owne man, confeſſeth <hi>Hierar. lib. 1. cap. 6.</hi> that their poiſon had defiled not a part, but almoſt the whole world: in ſo much that almoſt al the Biſhops not only of the eaſt, but alſo of the Weſt, by one meanes or other were blinded, and no ſmall time continued this hereſie: and this is certaine, that they bragged then as much of viſible ſucceſſion, of the name of the Church, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſality, as euer ſince you haue done: calling the true Chriſtians <hi>Homouſians</hi> (as you doe now <hi>Lutherans,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zwinglians</hi>) as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the writings of thoſe that wrote againſt them. You may ſee therefore, that theſe weapons or ſtaies, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to you with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous and condemned heretiques.

For we neuer denied the miniſtry of the true Church to be needefull (according to <hi>Vince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius rule) to finde out the true ſence of the ſcriptures:</hi> and certaine we are, that we are farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able, to iuſtifie our interpretations thereby, then you are yours: and he liuing a 1000. years agoe (as you write) we boldely affirme, that you ſhall neuer bee able to proue, that the Catholicke Church and her doctours and paſtours before or in his time, taught the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſies now taught by yours, for the which wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count yours Antichriſtian. And yet, as in the former Chapter moſt beggerly you begged this principle, that your doctrine is the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Catholicke faith: ſo here in this you begge this alſo, that your Church is the true and vndoubted Catholicke Church. But you muſt vnderſtand, howſoeuer your owne frendes will giue you at your firſt aſking both theſe, that yet we will graunt you neither of them both. And therefore writing (as you would ſeeme) purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt vs, you ſhould not thus miſerably alwaies haue begged them at our handes, but by ſound and iuſt proofe (at leaſt) haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to proue, that you had iuſt right thereunto, and then with ſome more honeſtie and credit might you haue gone on, in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, that they are yours. This alſo you muſt vnderſtand, that when it is in queſtion, which is the trueth of Religion, yea euen in the fundamentall points (as indeede it is betwixt you and vs) it is alwaies alſo in queſtion, which is the Church of Chriſt. For as both parts imagine, they haue the trueth, ſo will they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are the true Church. Your frendes alſo and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt bee aduertiſed, that it is no newe thing for damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, to brag much both of the truth of the titles of the Church &amp; of the doctours thereof, leaſt through too much ſimplicity, they think ſtreight, that you haue al theſe things on your ſide, becauſe you haue them ſo much and ſo often in your mouthes.

But howſoeuer you make ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, you haue all theſe, yet I ſay vnto you, with Saint <hi>Auguſt: De vnitate Eccleſiae, againſt the Epiſtle of Petilian chap.</hi> 10. <hi>That euen Catholique Biſhops are not to bee conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, if that anie where they be deceiued, in thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing contrarie to the Canonicall Scriptures.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when all commeth to all, and when otherwiſe you haue runne your ſelues out of breath, in concluſion (will you, will you) by theſe <hi>Canonicall Scriptures</hi> muſt it bee determined, whither you haue anie right to anie of theſe or no. For if you appeale from them (as indeede you doe) to the Church and fathers, they will ſende you backe againe for the triall, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which they ſpeake, bee true or no, onelie to the Scriptures: as it maie appeare vnto you, not onelie by this one place, which I haue cyted out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alreadie, but alſo by a number ſuch like places, both to bee founde in him elſe where, and alſo in others. For you maie reade in the firſt booke and ſeuenth Chapter of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that when <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſawe great controuerſies in the Church in the <hi>Nicene</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and perceaued that euerie ſeuerall companie bragged of the trueth, and ſo alſo of the Church, and fathers to bee on their ſide, to ende all thoſe controuerſies, he ſaied, <hi>Ex diuinitus inſpiratis oraculis quaeramus ſolutionem eorum quae propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur;</hi> that is, out of the oracles, that are come by diuine inſpiration (thereby meaning the Canonicall Scriptures) let vs ſeeke the determination of thoſe thinges that are propounded: and ſo they did. And as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour was of this minde, ſo it appeareth that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was of the ſame. For to <hi>Serap:</hi> hee ſaieth, <hi>Solum exſacris literis condiſcas</hi> (meaning, that the holie Ghoſt is God) <hi>ſufficiunt enim documenta, quae in illis reperias:</hi> Thou maieſt learne it onelie out of the holie Scriptures, for the documents or leſſons, which thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt finde in them, are ſufficient. And <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the 16. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in his tenth booke (agreeing herein with theſe) ſaieth, <hi>that onely by the holie Scriptures the difference of trueth from errour, in the examination thereof, is to bee diſcerned.</hi> And yet more plainely, the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> in his firſt Homilie vpon <hi>Ieremie</hi> writeth, <hi>of neceſsitie wee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18269:70"/> muſt call for the teſtimonie of the Scriptures: for our ſenſes and declarations without them as witneſſes, haue no credit.</hi> Well therefore ſaied <hi>Auguſtine, de naturâ &amp; gratiâ cap.</hi> 61. <hi>Onelie to the holy Scriptures doe I owe my conſent without refuſall:</hi> And therefore franckely hee telleth <hi>Hierome</hi> in his nineteenth Epiſtle: <hi>that hee had learned to yeelde that honour onely to the Canonicall Scriptures, to thinke that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours thereof therein neuer erred.</hi> Where he plainly ſheweth vs, by his example, how we ſhould reade his writings, or the writings of any other father, namely, beleeuing that which they wrote no fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, then we ſee it by ſcripture confirmed, or by probable argument not diſſenting from the trueth. And the like he teacheth yet more plainelie in his 111. <hi>&amp;</hi> 112. Epiſtles, to <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> &amp; in the proeme of the third booke of the Trinity. Wherefore with the ſame <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I confidently ſay and write, whither of Chriſt, or of his Church, or of any thing that appertaineth to our faith and life (I will not ſay wee, that are not to bee compared with him that ſaied though wee, but as hee addeth) though an Angell from Heauen ſhall preach any thing, beſides that yee haue receaued (marke hee ſaieth not contrarie, but beſides) in the legall and Euangelicall ſcriptures, let him be accurſed; in his third booke againſt <hi>Petilian. cap.</hi> 6. Yea your owne <hi>Vincentius</hi> in the very place quoted by you, denyeth not, but taketh it for graunted, that the ſcriptures of themſelues alone, are ſufficient for all things, yea and more then ſufficient. Whereupon it is euident that <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius,</hi> by the rule, line and true ſence of the Catholique Church, that there he ſpeaketh of, vnderſtandeth onely ſuch a ſence or line, as agreeth beſt with the ſcriptures themſelues, and the right rules of the interpreting of them, wherof more afterwards.

                  <p>TO this fourth chapter, I anſwere, that with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to finde out the true Church of God, wee as well as you, exhorte Chriſtes ſheepe, to followe the tracte of the flocke of Chriſt, and to feede by the tentes or Tabernacles of his ſheepheardes: that ſo they maie bee ledde on and vp, to Chriſt himſelfe. But then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as wee haue learned before, by that which hath beene noted in the former Chapter, concerning the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heretiques, eſpeciallie ſeeing the ſame confirmed in you, and other heretiques and apoſtataes in theſe our daies, that euerie flocke is not Chriſtes flocke, that will pretende ſo to bee: nor they alwaies his true ſheepeheardes, that are ſo accounted, wee wiſh euerie one that wilfullie is not diſpoſed to ſuffer himſelfe to bee ſeduced, by thoſe that falſely thus pretende, to learne to bee able (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the firſt Epiſtle and fourth verſe) <hi>to trie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, whether they be of God or no,</hi> which they ſhall and may doe in trying both the flockes, and their ſheepheardes, by the infallible worde of Chriſt contained in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. For Chriſtes ſheepe will heare and obey his voice, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. which vndoubtedlie and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently is ſounded in the written worde. <hi>For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make a man wiſe vnto ſaluation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus.

And therefore his true ſheepeheardes will feede his ſheepe, with the ſincere milke of this worde, becauſe that is it which they muſt deſire, <hi>as new borne babes doe milke, that they may growe vp thereby, if ſo be they haue taſted how boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull the Lord is.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.

By which rule, if the flockes and ſheepeheardes whom wee followe, bee tryed, they ſhal bee founde the ſheepe whoſe tracte is to bee followed, and the ſheepeheardes by whoſe tentes is ſafe feeding. And contrarilie by this rule, your flockes and ſheepeheardes (come to the tryall of it when you will) ſhal bee founde flockes of goates and not of ſheepe, and foxes and wolues, ſeeking the deſtruction of the ſheepe, rather then true ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes. But you would make the Reader beleeue, that <hi>Salomon</hi> in this place by you cyted, out of the firſt of the Canticles, doeth teach the true Church, ſafelie alwaies, to pitch her tentes, and to feede by the viſible and apparent ſucceſſion of paſtours which from age to age, can leade her without leauing her by the waie euen to Chriſtes time, Which you ſaie yours can doe, and ours cannot, boldlie aduouching, that vnleſſe we be not aſhamed to lie, wee cannot ſhew where our Church or Religion, was an hundreth yeares agoe, and that wee cannot denie, but <hi>Luther</hi> began to preach our new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in the yeare 1517. And thus againe, partlie by this note of viſible ſucceſſion of paſtours, and partly by vpbrayding vs with certaine differences of opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, about the maner of Chriſtes preſence, and diuerſe and ſundrie fantaſticall hereſies, that of late daies haue ſprung vp, and beene reuiued, you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to iuſtifie your Synagogue of Rome, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our Church of Chriſt: which thinges you harpe vpon, very much and often afterwarde in this your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.

For then it ſhould bee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that view of the ſtate of Chriſtes true Church, which I haue ſet downe vnto you, and prooued

                     </gap> of Chriſt, but there hath gone before a flocke, and ſhepheardes, which that may ſafely followe euen to the finding of Chriſt: yet it proueth not, that there hath alwaies immediately gone before it, from time to time, ſome viſible &amp; ſo apparent flockes and ſhepheards, one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeding another, as that the names of the ſheepe and ſhepheardes, are alwaies famouſly knowen, and therefore eaſily to be reckoned vp of euery one: which are the thinges, which you ſeeme to inferre hereof, and therefore require of vs to bee done, or elſe you would faine make the Reader beleeue, that wee neither are the Church, haue the trueth, nor true &amp; right miniſters thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, many waies, you offer vs great wrong, for after you your ſelfe (diſtruſting belike) that in any ſeate or line of Biſhops, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, this can be performed (ſpeaking of your line of Popes, whereof all the ſort of you bragge in this caſe moſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and drawe along your right ſucceſſion) you tell vs flatly, you meane not, when you ſpeak thereof, onely of them, but of al Biſhops elſwhere, that they may continue it, in the interruptions of that liue ſomewhere elſe: and yet at our handes, you require vnder the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aforeſaied, that we ſhould fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age, and from perſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, orderly ſucceeding one another, deduce ours.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18269:73"/> that our anſwere as a ſhift. Another wrong that you offer vs herein, is this, that your Antichriſtian Synagogue hauing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the propheſie <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. perſecuted our flocke into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, with the ſheepherdes thereof, you require that wee ſhould, euen in reſpect of ſuch decaied &amp; diſtreſſed times of the church, giue you as euident demonſtration of our flockes and ſheepheardes, as may bee giuen thereof in the floriſhing and peaceable ſtate of the ſame. For there is no reaſon in requiring that, in the decaies and ruines of the Church, which accompanieth alwaies the Church in her proſperous and ſtanding eſtate. Beſides, herein you offer vs the greater wrong, in that notwithſtanding it be graunted of vs, that both perpetuall continuance of the Catholique faith, and alſo ſome kinde of ſucceſſion therefore of teachers, be neceſſary alwaies for the continuation of the Church, yet you cannot but knowe (eſpecially ſeing that propheſie before named, &amp; that alſo 2. Theſ. 2. muſt bee fulfilled of the church of Chriſt, in reſpect of ſome time of her ſoiourning here on earth) that thereupon it followeth not, that therefore their ſucceſſion is viſible and demonſtrable alwaies, in your ſence, or elſe wee muſt yeelde, that there were none ſuch. For who is ſo ſimple, but hee is reſolued, that all men now aliue come by lineall ſucceſſion from ſome of <hi>Adams</hi> children, and yet fewe or none can bee found that can rightlie, no not the ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt harrold of them all, deduce their pedagree from thence. Muſt it therefore followe that there hath not alwaies beene, for all that, a certaine lineall deſcent? if you ſhould thus inferre, euery one might laugh at your follie. For long proceſſe of time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place, betwixt ſome of our progenitours and vs, lacke of Cronicles, or the neglect of ſuch genealogyes in them, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of names and countries, and diuerſe ſuch like things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the one not onely hard, but for the moſt part impoſſible, and yet no man doubteth of the certainty of the other. Euen ſo in this our preſent queſtion, moſt certaine it is, there haue alwaies beene both flockes &amp; ſheepherdes, to continue both the trueth &amp; Chriſtes church. For that wee graunt is neceſſarie: but yet through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, force of your Antichriſtian perſecution, diſtance perhaps of the flockes and ſheepeheards in place from vs, that God in ſome ages vnder your tyranny hath vſed to continue his church by, and lacke of faithfull and carefull writers to cronicle ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially your wouluiſh and foxy ſheepheardes, beeing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18269:74"/> alwaies watchfull, and mindefull to their vttermoſt, either to blot out their memories quite, in not ſuffering their Croniclers to mention them; or elſe in cauſing them to deface them, with ſtrange name and falſe ſlaunders, maketh it very hard (yea if impoſſible no marueile, you hauing the euidences, whereby we ſhould doe it, for the moſt part, a long time in your owne kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to vſe at your owne pleaſure) for vs to name from time to time, the places and perſons, that haue alwaies ſucceeded one another, for the continuance of our faith and Church. But to returne againe to the conſideration of this place of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: further I ſaie, as I ſaied before, that you erre in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging this or any other place of the Scripture, to proue that the Church of Chriſt may ſafely account thoſe flockes in poſſeſſion of the trueth, and therefore to bee followed: and thoſe ſheepheardes true ſheepheardes, and therefore meete al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee conſented vnto: that lineally downe from Chriſt can deduce their perſonall ſucceſſion. For ſo (as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt Chapter, and it is not denyed of your ſelues) ſundry heretiques in their times, haue done and can doe ſtill. If therefore you ſay, you meane ſtill that flocke and thoſe ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, that together with their viſible perſonall ſucceſſion, haue alwaies beene in poſſeſſion of the true ancient faith, I anſwere, firſt, you begge ſtill the thing in queſtion, in ſuppoſing that, to haue beene alwaies ioyned with your flockes and ſheepheards, which we ſay, and are able to proue, they fell from many hundreth yeares ago.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I tell you once againe, and now this time for all, that you ſhall neuer bee able to proue, but that both that perſonall ſucceſſion may bee ſeparated from trueth, and alſo trueth from it, and that therefore it is neither a certaine meanes to knowe the trueth, nor the Church of Chriſt by. Thirdly, for your collection out of this place, for the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of your Church before ours, becauſe (as you ſay) from time to time, for this thouſand and fiue hundreth yeares, you can ſhew the deſcent and continuance of yours, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of ours for one hundreth yeares, no not beyonde the yeare one thouſand fiue hundreth and ſeuenteene, we affirme that both in the one, and in the other, herein you write vntruely. For firſt, if your Church as it is now either in reſpect of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18269:74"/> or gouernement thereof, bee compared with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Roman Church in the Apoſtles times, or for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after, there is ſuch diuerſitie betwixt the one and the other, as that the one beeing founde the chaſt ſpouſe of Chriſt, the other muſt needes bee proued to bee the very whoar of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The ſimplicity of the miniſterie that then was, is turned amongſt you into a pompous, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more then Princely prelacy. And then the Church was fedde, with the pure worde of God, conteyned in the Scriptures, and ſo ledde thereby perfectly to vnderſtand the will of God; and with you, as carefullie as may bee, that is kept from her, and in ſteede thereof, ſhee is fedde with the dreames, inuentions, and traditions of men. Then ſhe was taught to account the name of Chriſt, <hi>the onelie name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commeth ſaluation, Act. 4. and therefore that in him all thinges were prepared: Math. 22.</hi> and now with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, Saintes, Angels, your owne merites, and the merites of others, ſatiſfaction in this life by your ſelues, and after by others, with a number of baſer things, muſt ioyne with him in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of interceſſion betwixt vs and God, and in the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke of our ſaluation: as though hee either could not or would not, go perfectly through with the worke of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in himſelfe, and by himſelfe, but had ſo begunne it, as that the accompliſhing and perfecting thereof were left to theſe vaine and fooliſh by-meanes. Then her faithfull doctours and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers taught her, that Chriſt, in ſaying, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> this is my body, meant, that it was a ſigne &amp; figure of his body, as you may reade in <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Adimantus,</hi> the <hi>Maniche cap.</hi> 12. and in <hi>Tertull.</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion cap.</hi> 4. and in infinite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces elſewhere, in the ancient fathers: and now contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea to the verie nature of a ſacrament, contrary to the analogie of faith and good manners, yours teach, that thoſe wordes being vttered by your Prieſtes, thereupon followeth ſuch a tranſubſtantiation of the bread into his bodie, that whoſoeuer receiueth the outward parte of that ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, receiueth in by his mouth, the naturall bodie of Chriſt. If thus I were diſpoſed to go a long, as farre as I might, and to leade the reader to a full view of the difference, betwixt the Romiſh Church that nowe

But further of theſe differences I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as you may reade Chapter 19. &amp; 20. and elſe where in this booke. And Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> againſt <hi>Stapletons Fortreſſe,</hi> hath noted out of <hi>Bede</hi> and other authours of good credit 50. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the church of the Engliſh Saxons in the time of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the monke (who was 600. yeares after Chriſt at the leaſt) and the Popiſh church, that now is; and infinite be the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences then, betwixt the Church before, in her puerer times, and the Popiſh Synagogue now. And therefore whatſoeuer you bragge, neither you, nor all your fellowes, ſhall euer be able to proue indeede, that your perſonall ſucceſſion hath beene ioyned with the continuance of one and ſelfeſame doctrine of Chriſt, vnto theſe daies.</p>
                  <p>And to come to the other point, therein I ſaie, you write vntruely alſo. For ſo far of is it, that we graunt <hi>Luther</hi> to haue beene the firſt that preached the Goſpell that wee now embrace, and that wee cannot ſhewe by whom and where it was preached and receaued before: that there is nothing more common with vs, in anſwering this your obiection of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then to tell you, that ſo farre of is it, that it is newe indeede, that it is the very ancient Religion and Goſpell, taught both in the olde teſtament and newe: and therefore (though it grieue you) wee tell you that the ancient Patriarches and Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, taught the verie ſame, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the ancient doctours and fathers, as farre forth as they were able to iuſtify that which they taught, by the Scriptures, were ſheepheardes of our church, and teachers of our Religion. Indeede, we confeſſe, that as <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt in <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time (2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.) found the booke of God, and was ſo a meanes to bring thoſe thinges to light, that by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked proceedings of <hi>Manaſſes, Amon</hi> and others, had for a certaine ſeaſon lien hid: So <hi>Luther</hi> in theſe late daies was a ſinguler inſtrument of God, to reuiue and bring to light diuerſe pointes of Chriſtian faith, which your Antichriſtian Synagogue had long laboured to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hide from the eies of the Church. And yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it no more followeth, that he was the firſt that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched our Religion, then vpon the former it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18269:75"/> that <hi>Hilkiah</hi> was then firſt the meanes, to preach the lawe of God. And I tell you truely, that I cannot maruaile yet ſufficientlie, that anie man of anie reaſon, iudgement and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as you would ſeeme to bee) ſhould be ſo farre paſt all ſhame, as confidently to ſet downe in print, <hi>that wee cannot deny, but that Luther</hi> 1517. <hi>began firſt our Church and Religion: &amp; that we can name none</hi> 100. <hi>or</hi> 200. <hi>yeares before, that taught it:</hi> when you cannot be ignorant (vnleſſe your ignorance be verie groſſe) that we name vnto you verie manie, and that in all ages, to haue beene of the ſame Religion and Church, that wee are now of. For firſt there is nothing more vſuall with vs, then to tell you, that all the ancient Patriarches, Prophets, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and Apoſtles (witneſſe the canonicall Scriptures) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and died in our Church and Religion. The ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee tell you wee haue of all the Chriſtian martyrs (whoſe number is infinite) that were ſlaine in the firſt 300. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, vnder the 10. bloudy perſecutions, that were in that time. For during that time, our Religion was onelie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and embraced in the Church, and verie little or nothing was there of thoſe opinions, for the which eſpeciallie, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your Religion Antichriſtian (vnleſſe it were of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and ſuch as had learned it of them) in thoſe daies once thought of. And after for three hundreth yeares more at leaſt, in all the moſt ſubſtantiall pointes of Chriſtian Religion, and the greateſt queſtions betwixt vs and you, all the ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and the Chriſtians that liued in their times (as wee haue diuerſe times ſayed, ſo haue wee often ſo proued it, that you ſhall neuer bee able therein to diſproue vs) were fully ours. And though after theſe times, when <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, had once obteined of that traiterous murderer <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian title of <hi>Oecumenicall, or vniuerſall Biſhop,</hi> the myſterie of iniquity did euery day work more plainelie then other, &amp; haſted to his height: yet (as I haue ſhewed in my anſwere to your publiſhers preface, and in the ſixteenth Chapter of this my anſwere to your ſelfe, where you bragge againe, as you doe here, of 1500. yeares antiquity and continuance) there were after theſe times from time to time, that both ſpied the growth and proceeding thereof, and ſet themſelues againſt it. For <hi>Bertram &amp; Iohannes Scotus,</hi> were with vs againſt your

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a booke writen 400. yeares ago, which is ſuppoſed was writen by one <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> for (as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) much about that time was hee put to death of the Romiſh cleargie: in which booke the authour grieuouſly complaineth, of the enormities amongſt the ſaied Cleargie, and findeth many faultes in the Romiſh Church. <hi>Gisburne</hi> alſo in his ſtorie writeth, that in the yeare 1158. <hi>Dulcinus Naua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſis</hi> and <hi>Gerrhardus,</hi> preached earneſtly, <hi>that the Pope was Antichriſt:</hi> and that they had thirtie followers, whom they brought into <hi>England,</hi> who were perſecuted then, here for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that, and other ſuch like doctrine againſt the Romiſh Church. Much about this time (but ſomewhat rather before) a company of Chriſtians (who by your Prelates were nickenamed <hi>Albigenſes</hi>) did floriſh: and there were great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them, euen about <hi>Tholoſſa</hi> (whereof you Maſter <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi> are called <hi>Archdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>) who did vehemently reſiſt your Pope, and his proceedings, ſetting vp vnto themſelues a Biſhop, whom they called <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> oppugning the groſſe pointes of your Religion, euen as wee doe: witneſſe <hi>Nicolas Triuet</hi> and others, in their Stories. <hi>Hildegarde,</hi> though ſhee were a Nunne, yet in the yeare 1146. propheſied the ruine of your kingdome at <hi>Rome,</hi> and bitterly inueighed againſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your Cleargie and Friers. So did <hi>Geffery Chaucer</hi> about the ſame time (namely in his Dialogue called <hi>Iacke Vpland</hi>) very ſaltly taunt, and deride the vanity of your frierly ſuperſtition. In the yeare 1164. was <hi>Petrus Valdus</hi> a citizen of <hi>Lions,</hi> whoſe followers after had giuen them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe names, to diſgrace them withall. For your frendes call them <hi>Waldenſes, Albigenſes, pauperes de Lugduno, Picardos, Boſlauienſes, Thaboritas,</hi> and <hi>Leoniſtas,</hi> changing their titles and names, according to the diuerſities of places and times they liued in, howſoeuer their Religion was all one. And theſe haue beene of ancient time, and of great continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in very many places, namely in <hi>Prouince, Sarmatia, Lyuonia, Bohemia, Morauia, Polonia, Sileſia, Belgia,</hi> and in <hi>Calabria:</hi> and of you whereſoeuer, or whenſoeuer they were, they haue beene cruelly perſecuted for heretiques: and yet if their opinions bee iudged of, not as you (the more to diſgrace
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18269:76"/> them) haue charged them, but as they in their owne confeſſions of their faith and Apologies, haue ſet them downe, they in many thinges helde the verie ſame that wee doe, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame for errours in you, that wee now doe. They are of 400. yeares continuance at leaſt. For <hi>Aeneas Syluius</hi> a man of your owne (for he was Pope ere he died) writeth, handling the ſtories of <hi>Boeme,</hi> that they had continued vnto his time from the yeare 1160. And <hi>Gulielmus Paruus</hi> writeth, that their doctrine was examined in <hi>Oxforde,</hi> and found ſound, concerning God and the merites of Chriſt (for your doctrine concerning the iorning of our owne merites with Chriſtes, to make vp full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction and redemption, is of farre later inuention) and their life (ſaieth hee) was commendable, but in the doctrine of the Sacrament, they were found to differ from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea <hi>Reinerus</hi> a writer 300. yeares ago, who (as he himſelfe ſaith) was often at the examination of them, in his booke of inquiſitions, writing of them, calling them <hi>Leoniſts,</hi> confeſſeth that ſome ſaied they had continued from <hi>Sylueſters</hi> time, and that ſome ſaied, they had beene euen from the time of the Apoſtles: &amp; he further reports that they had great ſhew of holy life, in liuing iuſtly before men, and that they beleeued all things well of God, and all the articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the creede: onely he chargeth them, that they hated &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the Romiſh Church. And this he further writes, that there was no land, wherein that ſect did not creepe, &amp; ſpeaking but of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but in one cuntrey, yet this he teſtifieth, that they had there, ten ſchooles in one pariſh, called <hi>Camach,</hi> that there were forty congregations or Churches of them, euery one hauing their leaders or teachers, and that their power in his time was ſuch, that none (as hee ſaieth) durſt then openlie reſiſt them. There are yet to bee ſeene (as good authours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) the conſultations and records of the proceedings of foure great Biſhops in <hi>France</hi> againſt them, writen three hundreth yeares ago; namely of <hi>Narbonenſis, Arelatenſis, Aquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and <hi>Albanenſis:</hi> yea 355. yeares ago, I read, there was a Councell kept in <hi>Tholoſſa</hi> eſpecially againſt them. And yet though both of ancient times, and later daies, the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſought to roote them out by all poſſible cruelty, they and their ſucceſſours continue vnto this day, in great numbers in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in other places.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:18269:77"/>
                  <p>But becauſe you very oft in this your booke, and the reſt of your ſide continually beare the ſimple reader, and vnlearned Chriſtian in hand, that before <hi>Luther</hi> there were none of our religion, that haue ſo condemned your Church and religion, as we doe: I wil vouchſafe for the better inabling of euery one, that ſhall read this my anſwere, to ſee your vanity and impiety (though this which I haue noted already be ſufficient to lay open your folly) to proceed yet ſomewhat further in this matter. Wherefore (to go on in the courſe of times) though your popiſh Church hath bene in her ruffe, and at the heigheſt, that euer ſhe was, this latter 400 yeares, yet we are able to ſhew, that there haue bene many euen in this time from time to time (and that in ſundry places) that haue ioyned with vs againſt you, &amp; that therefore, there is no ſuch newneſſe, or ſtrangenes in our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a d doings, as you would make the ignorant beleeue. For in the dayes of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9, in the yeare 1230 the Greeke Church, and other Eaſterne Churches did quite forſake communion with yours: who euer ſince ioyne with vs, in a number of thinges againſt you, as namely in withſtanding <hi>the ſupremacy of your Romiſh Biſhop,</hi> as appeareth not onely by one Epiſtle that <hi>Germanus</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>of Conſtantinople</hi> wrote vnto the pope in the yeare 1237, but alſo by a large booke, writen about the yeare 1384 by <hi>Nilus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> wherein he doeth not onely confute his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> euen as we doe, but alſo he enueigheth againſt al thoſe that hold communion with the Popiſh or latin Church. And (as it appeareth in ancient record, in the Church of <hi>Herford,</hi> wherein 29 of the Articles, wherein they differ from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſet downe) they ioine not only with vs in this point, in ſeperating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romiſh Church, &amp; in denying the popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (which is the very foundation of your Church and religion) but alſo in denying purgatory, and maſſes for the dead, in holding it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for their miniſters, to enioy the benefit of matrimony, in not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any priuate maſſe, in not denying the cup to any that receaue, in not miniſtring the communion in priuate houſes, in not vſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnction, and in ſundry other points. And by diuers Epiſtles writen from thence of late, extant in print both in greeke and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, to <hi>Chitreus</hi> and other <hi>Germans,</hi> it euidently appeareth, that they ioyne with vs againſt the Romiſh Church in many other great and weighty points of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that great hope there is, that they might eaſily be brought to ioyne with vs in the reſt. Beſides
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18269:77"/> theſe Eaſterne churches, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here in theſe weſterne parts, euident it is, that there haue beene many great, learned and famous perſons, with innumerable followers, at all tymes from age to age, in theſe latter 400 yeares, when the tyranny of your popes to repreſſe them hath bene the greateſt and ſtrongeſt, that euer it was, which yet haue openly with vs ſtood forth againſt them and their religion. For <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi> the ſecond (as diuers other Emperours had beene before him) as namely <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the 5. <hi>Leo</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the 6 in the Eaſt, and <hi>Henry the</hi> 4 and 5 in the Weſt) was a notable <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> of the 3 popes in his time, contending againſt them, to maintaine the authority of Chriſtian princes againſt their vſurped Supremacy ouer them, about the yeare 1260, as notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cronicles of thoſe times writen by your owne men <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, Sabelicus</hi> and others declare. And 20 years before that, <hi>Kra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> teſtifieth in his hiſtory: that there were many that preached o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in <hi>Sueuia, that the Pope was an heretique, his clergy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniakes, and generally they all ſeducers of the people.</hi> Ten yeares after that, floriſhed <hi>Arnoldus De nouâ villâ, a Spaniard,</hi> who taught, <hi>that Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeduced the world, that the faith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught, was but ſuch as deuils had</hi> (meaning belike a bare hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall faith) <hi>that the pope led men to hell, that he and his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy did falſifie the doctrine of Chriſt, that maſſes were naught &amp; not to be ſaied for the dead &amp;c.</hi> and therefore your popiſh Church condemned him for an heretique. Much what about the ſame time was <hi>Gulielmus De Sancto amore,</hi> a maſter and chiefe ruler then in <hi>Paris,</hi> who went as farre as <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> applying the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which concerne Antichriſt, as we doe, to the pope and his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: and therefore hee alſo was condemned for an heretique, and his bookes burnt by your popiſh rout. And in the yeare 1260 <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Anglicus</hi> a maſter of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo, tooke this <hi>Williams</hi> part againſt the pope, &amp; wrote a booke in his defence. In the yeare 1290 <hi>Petrus Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes,</hi> a Minorite, directly preached <hi>the pope to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and Rome great Babylon,</hi> and therefore he was burnt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was dead. 30 yeares and more before this, <hi>Robert Groſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> a famous learned man, and Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (for hee died in the yeare one thouſand two hunderd fifty three) was a great withſtander of the popes tyranny, and three dayes before his death, hauing conference with his clergy, he laboureth to make them ſee by ſundry demonſtrations, <hi>that the pope was Antichriſt, and his

Whiles he liued, he had many great learned men here in England that ioyned with him, as namely <hi>Nicholas Herford, Philip Repington, Iohn Aſhton, and Laurence Redeman,</hi> and ſo many followers had he, and they and hee had ſuch fauour and protection, eſpecially of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that then was, that though your prelates here in England vexed and moleſted them what they could; yet they and their fauourers in ſhort tyme grew to that ſtrength and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that by the yeare 1422 <hi>Henry Chicheley</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> certified the pope, that they all could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, they were ſo many, but by force of warre. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Iohn Wicklifes</hi> tyme and the floriſhing of <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> (which was about the yeare 1410) very many both here and elſewhere for following <hi>Wicklife</hi> were perſecuted, as namely here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>William Swinderley, Walter Brute, William Sautry, Iohn Badby, and William Thorpe,</hi> whereof diuerſe were moſt cruellie burned.

And therefore though it hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had ſo viſible and glorious a ſucceſſion of pompous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, and proud prelates, as yours hath had, for theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tymes, ſince Antichriſt grew to his pride and height; yet it hath neuer beene without flockes and ſheepheardes, one going before another in the profeſſion of our religion, euen vp from our dayes vnto Chriſt. But when for very ſhame, conuicted with the force of the trueth, you are driuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that in ſome parte it may be true, that there were alwaies ſome that ioyned with vs, yet to driue vs from alleadging their names and ſucceſſion againſt you, you ſay, <hi>they yet helde ſo many different and lewde opinions, that we cannot fetch any continuance to our faith or religion from them.</hi> Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwer, firſt, that we are not to beleeue your reportes of them, but their owne Apologies and writings: whereby it appeareth, that it hath bene alwaies your faſhion (the more thereby to diſcredit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)

And laſtly (to driue you from this ſhift) we tell you, that if you will countenance your religion and Church with none, but with thoſe that agree with you fully in all pointes, there is neuer an ancient father for 600 yeares, no not any writer, or paſtour in the Church of any good credit, for 1000 yeares, that you may make any reckoning of: &amp; that (which then wil go very neare you) euen ſince <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the monkes comming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as I haue ſaied) and for 300 yeares after him, your glorious ſucceſſion muſt faile: there are ſo many apparent differences for ſo long ſpace at leaſt, betwixt the opinions, that your paſtors and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hold now, and them that were held then.

For who knoweth not, that it is no ſtrange or new thing, to finde the deare ſeruants of God, and the true members of Chriſts Church ſometimes and in ſome things differing, and hoatly diſſenting in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion?

Neither was the controuerſie ſmall betwixt them, about the rebaptizing of thoſe, that had beene before onely baptized by heretiques. For proofe of both which points, I refer you to the third and fourth Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprians</hi> firſt booke of Epiſtles, and to the firſt Epiſtle of his ſecond booke, and to the third and fourth Chapters of <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th booke. <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo, and the Church of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> (as it is well knowen) were at hoat contention about Eccleſiaſticall ſonges and ceremonies. <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had betweene them a violent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome contention, and great part taking there was of both ſides, and that along time. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Theodoret,</hi> in a controuerſie of Catholicke religion. Betwixt <hi>Miletius</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and one <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and their followers of both ſides, there aroſe and continued a long whyle, to the great trouble of the Church, a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contention. All Eccleſiaſticall ſtories (for the moſt part) haue with griefe made report of theſe: yea downe from Chriſt to the age wherein euery one of them wrote, it too plainly appeares in them, that there was neuer yet any one century of yeares, but it hath had new contentions and thoſe many, not onely betwixt heretiques and catholickes, but alſo euen amongſt thoſe that otherwiſe of both ſides, were to bee reputed ſounde Chriſtians. <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (as all men will confeſſe) were in their times worthy ſo to be accounted, and yet it appeareth in their works, that there was great diuerſity of opinions, and that in many things of great moment betwixt them. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (of whom I ſpake before) were both famous Chriſtians, and yet the ſtories of their tymes ſhew, that they were bitter enemies.

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18269:82"/> by the bookes offered vnto him one againſt an other found, that they then had amongſt themſelues many contentions and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of opinions: and infinite it were, to reckon vp all the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that might eaſily be found to this end. Indeede I reade, for theſe and ſuch like differences, the Iewes and Heathen people, mocked at the Chriſtians, and hereby ſought mightily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them and their religion: ſeuenth <hi>Stromat: Clement: Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrini.</hi> But I neuer read, that either then or ſince, euer any ſounde Chriſtian (though for this cauſe they tooke occaſion to mourne) yet that they or any of them tooke occaſion to condemne either the one ſide, or the other, or both; as not to be therefore at all of the Church of Chriſt. For, notwithſtanding theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, they ſaw, that they ioyned togither otherwiſe as brethren in holding togither the fundamentall pointes. And that they, whom you call <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> doe ſo, the booke of late ſet forth of the Harmony of the confeſſions of all the Churches, that herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts profeſſe the Goſpell, doeth make it moſt manifeſt and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And therfore for any force, that this reaſon carieth with it, this their differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (which is in effect only about <hi>the maner of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>) they both may be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the true ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Catholick Church, as wel as theſe other, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue named.</p>
                  <p>Another wronge that herein they offer vs is this, that beeing themſelues at variance amongſt themſelues, and hauing had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great contentions, and yet hauing ſtill ſome, about as great a matter of religion, as this: that yet forgetting the beame in their owne eies, like hypocrites, they are ſo buſie with the moate in ours. For who ſo readeth the hiſtories of their Popes writen by their owne frendes, beſides a number of hoat and contentious ſchiſmes, troubling all Chriſtendome, for many yeares togither, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fourty years, continuing betwixt their Popes &amp; Antipopes, he ſhall finde it ſo common a thing for the ſucceeding Pope, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the proceedings of his predeceſſour, as though the chiefe glorie of their papacy lay in that: and therefore, poore <hi>Gratian</hi> tooke a comberſome worke in hand, to make a concorde of ſuch diſcording Canons. Their religion conſidered, it is one of the greateſt controuerſies that can be, <hi>whither the pope or a generall councell, haue the ſuperiour authority;</hi> and ſo muſt be the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier of the Churches tongue, to decide and determine controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: and yet euen in this controuerſie, they are ſo at concorde, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18269:82"/> the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> determined one way, and the councels of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Ferraria</hi> the other way, and yet both ſides hath his ſtout champions. The <hi>Scotiſtes</hi> and <hi>Thomiſtes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an hundred yeares haue beene at contention, &amp; yet (doubtles) are not agreed, <hi>about the conception of the Virgin Mary, whither it were in ſinne or no,</hi> &amp; about diuers &amp; ſundry other great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their religion. Yea euen in the Sacrament of the body and bloude of Chriſt (wherein they would ſeeme to be at greateſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) yet if a man were diſpoſed to note the diuers opinions therein amongſt themſelues, he ſhould ſcarſe euer knowe, when to make an ende. For there be ſome of them that holde, <hi>that there Chriſts body is torne and chewed with the teeth</hi> (as it appeareth in the Recantation, that they preſcribe to <hi>Beringarius</hi>) others (as <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund: de Conſecra: Diſt:</hi> 2.) thinke that too groſſe. Some (as <hi>Gardener</hi>) would haue <hi>Hoc</hi> to ſignifie <hi>indiuiduum vagum,</hi> a certaine thing that is, but they cannot tell what: others now would haue it to note that, which is vnder the accidentes of bread and wine. <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth, holde conſecration to be, not by the fiue wordes, but by Chriſts bleſſing: others holde now that it is done, by the fiue wordes. When it commeth to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſome holde that it entreth the mouth, but no further: others wil haue it to paſſe into the ſtomacke, but not into the guttes: others wil haue it to go thither alſo. Infinite are the queſtions, that they are fallen into about this matter. And in their laſt conuenticle at <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> where they had hoped to haue healed all theſe ſores, yet euen then there grew a great contention betwixt two great captaynes of theirs, Archbiſhop <hi>Catharinus,</hi> and Frier <hi>Soto;</hi> and that about no ſmall matters, namely, <hi>about aſſured confidence of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God: Predeſtination, originall ſinne, free-will,</hi> and ſuch like matters; Inſomuch, that for all the councell could doe, for ſix yeares together, they continuallie went on in writing bookes bitterly one againſt another. The ſame <hi>Catharin</hi> alſo, wrote a booke againſt <hi>Caietan</hi> a Cardinall, laying therein to his charge 200. errours. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention alſo the ſame <hi>Catharin</hi> had, with <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſcus Torrenſis,</hi> a man otherwiſe of his owne faction, about ſingle life of prieſts, &amp; reſidence of Biſhops, both which, the one helde was (as hee taught therein) warranted by Gods worde, the other ſtoutly holding the contrary. In the Articles of iuſtification, free grace, and originall ſinne, <hi>Ruard Tapper</hi> a great Papiſt and Deane of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18269:83"/> 
                     <hi>Colen,</hi> in his ſecond tome, wrote againſt <hi>Piggius</hi> an Archpiller of that Synagogue, contending to proue, that he was deceiued and erred in thoſe pointes. But what ſhould I take vpon me, to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon vp the contentions and controuerſies that are amongſt them: For certaine it is, they are ſo many and infinite, that a man, if he were diſpoſed, might write a booke of a whole quire of paper, conſiſting onely of a bare recitall of the differences of opinions, that their writers haue ſet downe in their owne bookes, about points and queſtions of religion. And yet ſee, as though there neuer had beene iarre amongſt them, they brag of vnity amongſt the ſimple, and labour our diſgrace, with the obiection of variety of opinions amongſt vs, eſpecially about this one point, of the maner of Chriſts reall preſence in the ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing now hereby in parte you ſee, at what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are, I hope you thinke it reaſon; that they ſhould agree better amongeſt themſelues, before they inſult any more againſt vs, for our diſagreement. Laſtly, they doe vs wrong, in ſeeking to diſgrace vs and our religion, in that ſince <hi>Luther</hi> beganne to preach, there haue riſen vp diuerſe and ſundrie fonde and fooliſh heretiques. For wee read, that immediatly after the Apoſtles tymes, euen within few yeares, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> by his tyme, could reckon vp eighty, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> more ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall errours and hereſies, which in effect did growe togither with the Goſpell, and yet the Goſpell not to be blamed therefore, but Sathan, who where the good ſeedes-man ſowed good ſeede, vſeth to ſowe alſo his tares: <hi>Matthew</hi> the thirteenth. And yet it ſeemeth by Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> preuention of this obiection, that ſome, aſwell affected to the Goſpell then belike, as you be now, were ready hereby to diſcredit both the Apoſtles, and their doctrine. But <hi>Iohns</hi> anſwere is, <hi>they went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would haue continued vvith vs. But this came to paſſe, that it might appeare, that they were not all of vs:</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. Euen ſo, wee anſwere you concerning thoſe, that you ſay, <hi>haue any where ſince Luther riſen amongſt vs, and fallen into hereſies.</hi> Yet further, ſo much the more apparent is the wronge that you offer vs in this behalfe, in that not onely you knowe, we ſhun communion with them, as wel as you: but that alſo it euidently hath appeared to the world, that wee haue beene
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18269:83"/> both the firſt and the forwardeſt in detecting of them, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of them from time to time. Wherfore I conclude, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you haue ſaied nothing of any force, for the iuſtification either of your vocation, Church, or religion.</p>

For neither your Church, nor faith was in his dayes. We grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you alſo, <hi>that Irenaeus did vrge ſucceſſion of perſons, to ſtop the mouthes of the heretiques,</hi> as you ſhew in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of him: but withal then you muſt not forget, that he liued not long after the Apoſtles times, when as yet they, whoſe Succeſſion he alleadged, continued in the ſincerity of the Apoſtolique doctrine,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18269:84"/> from which long ago your Roman Church, as it is now, hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by antichriſtian apoſtacy.

But <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> no where preſcribeth, that his example of vrging hereticks to ſee their folly by Succeſſion, for a perpetuall rule to followe; neither therein doeth he prophecy, that for <hi>1000</hi> yeares after, &amp; further, thoſe ſucceſſiue lines of Biſhops, or any other would continue ſo in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the trueth of doctrine, as that ſafely alwaies they might be ioyned vnto. For he was not ignorant, what was prophecied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the comming of Antichriſt, <hi>2, Theſſ. 2.</hi> and <hi>Reuel. 17.</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> tolde to the Paſtors of <hi>Epheſus (Act. 20.) that after his depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, there would ariſe vp euen amongſt themſelues grieuous wolues not ſparing the flock:</hi> which muſt needs import, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in his time he thought ſometimes of ſucceſſion of biſhops, that continued in the trueth; that yet it was farre from his meaning to prophecy, that ſo it would be alwaies. You reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this point as one; that to proue the ſtewes at <hi>Rome</hi> now to be pure virgins, ſhould alleadge for proofe thereof, that they were ſo when they were yong children. For euen like difference and ods there is, betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now, and her biſhops and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and that that was in the daies &amp; times, that you and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, that you alleage, ſpeake of. For whereas vnto theſe times, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; her biſhops &amp; paſtours, ſtoode and continued in the trueth; ſince, not only many of the biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelues, whom you hold are freeſt &amp; furtheſt of, of al other from erring (as I haue ſhewed already moſt plainly) fell into hereſie, but alſo al your Romiſh doctrine, which we now count &amp; cal papiſtical, was diuiſed &amp; found out ſince thoſe times, and is alſo not only beſide, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine then taught &amp; receiued, by the ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; her paſtours; as, ere I haue done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, I hope (at leaſt in great part) ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to proue. It ſhould ſeeme therfore, that either you in thus reaſoning are very childiſh your ſelfe, or els you thinke you haue to deale but with babes and fooles; in that becauſe <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> that floriſhed within two hundred yeares after Chriſt (when the Church was yet pure and vndefiled, in compariſon of the tymes that followed) could and did vrge Succeſsion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18269:85"/> of perſons ioined with ſucceſſion of trueth: therefore you may, that liue <hi>1500.</hi> yeares after Chriſt and more. You muſt firſt proue, that ſucceſſion of trueth is vnſeparable from perſonall ſucceſſion, &amp; that euer ſince, and now alſo, the Biſhops &amp; paſtours, whoſe perſonall ſucceſſion you bragge of, haue continued in the trueth as well, as they did, whoſe names he reciteth. Whereof neither, ſhall either you or any of you be able to proue, as long as the world ſtandeth. Fye therefore for ſhame, that you neuer hauing proued either of theſe, nor yet being able to doe it, you ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription againſt our doctrine (which you call newe, at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure though indeede it be moſt ancient; witneſſe the olde teſtament and the newe) much rather ought to take place, then his in his time againſt heretiques, that then taught diuerſe baſphemous hereſies directly againſt the ſcriptures. You ſay, our Religion hath beene vnknowen this <hi>1500.</hi> yeares: or at leaſt, if any body ſought to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, he was condemned as a falſe pernitious heretique. But you doe but ſay thus, you proue it not, nor euer ſhall. For it was both heard and knowen, many <hi>100.</hi> yeares before yours was hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and if euery one were ſo condemned that taught it, then was Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſo condemned. For vnleſſe by ſcriptures we can proue ours to be, the ſame that theirs was, wee aſke no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at your hands. And as long as we can doe ſo, the more we and our predeceſſours haue beene condemned by you, the more we knowe, we haue beene bleſſed of God. Now whereas you ſay in this Chapter further, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did withſtand heretiques, <hi>by the traditions of the Apoſtles,</hi> adding your gloſſe, that is to ſay, <hi>by doctrine not writen, but deliuered from hand to hand, and ſo receiued from age to age, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles to that time:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in through the ambiguity of the word <hi>(Tradition)</hi> craftſly you ſeeke to deceiue your ſimple reader, and indeede you giue a gloſſe, that corrupteeh the text. For let that place of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his third booke and ſecond Chapter be peruſed, and that alſo which followeth in the third Chapter of the ſame booke (though either you or the Printer miſtaking it, ſend vs to the fifth Chapter, where the wordes are not, which you cite) and moſt euidently it ſhall bee proued, that though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> haue there the words by you cited, yet by the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Apoſtles, which he ſpeaketh of there, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no doctrine, nor points of doctrine (as you doe vſually by that word) contrary, or beſides that, which was alſo taught in the word
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18269:85"/> writen. For the queſtion was of God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinian</hi> &amp; <hi>Marcion</hi> denied: againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he there ſheweth, that he fought firſt with the ſcriptures: wherewith when they were vrged, he ſaith, <hi>they are turned ſtreight into an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcriptures, as though they were not right, had not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, might diuerſly be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> ſaying further, <hi>that trueth could not be found of them, by thoſe that are ignorant of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the trueth was not deliuered by them, but by liuely voice:</hi> &amp; that therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaied, <hi>we ſpeake wiſedome amongſt them that are perfect, not the wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of this world. And this wiſdome to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>is that which he himſelfe hath deuiſed.</hi> Of which heretiques (their wordes &amp; yours, when you are called to the touchſtone of the ſcriptures, are ſo like) vndoubtedly you haue learned to plead againſt the ſcriptures, for your vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now when thus he had ſhewed, how the heretiques in his time, ſhunned triall by the ſcriptures, and appealed to tradition, he goeth on and ſheweth, that when he was contented to come to the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apoſtles, kept &amp; obſerued in the church, downe from the Apoſtles to thoſe times by ſucceſſion of paſtours, then they reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted tradition alſo, ſaying, that they were wiſer, then either thoſe paſtours, or the Apoſtles themſelues: and ſo indeede neither by the ſcriptures, nor yet by making demonſtration vnto them, that the ſame doctrine taught in the ſcripture, was alſo deliuered by liuely voice, firſt by the Apoſtles, and ſo receiued from age to age and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in by thoſe paſtors, of whoſe ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh, could ſtop their mouthes. And thus any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meane capacity may perceiue, that in theſe places <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his drift only is, to ſhew the heretiques, that the doctrine which he taught, concerning God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, firſt was warranted by the Apoſtles writings, and then alſo taught by them, by liuely voice, and ſo deliuered and continued from hand to hand, amongſt the faithfull paſtours, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another euen vnto that time. And that he calleth this the tradition of the Apoſtles, and not (as you falſly expound him) <hi>doctrine vnwriten,</hi> beſide or contrary to that which is writen (as the Popiſh traditions you ſtriue for bee) if you had beene diſpoſed you might haue learned in the <hi>1.</hi> Chapter of the ſame booke, where he ſaieth, <hi>That which firſt they preached, after by the wil of god, tradiderunt nobis, they deliuered vs in writing, to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and piller of our faith.</hi> And indeede it is an vſuall thing,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18269:86"/> with the fathers of the primitiue Church, often by the tradition of the Apoſtles, to vnderſtand the very ſame doctrine, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in their writings. Herein therefore, &amp; ſo likewiſe in all other points in controuerſy betwixt vs, it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tricke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you papiſts, to vrge the fathers wordes quite contrary to their true meaning.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe you firſt, and namely bring in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen traditions, which is the window indeede, that you would haue faine left open vnto you, for then thereby, you hope you may thruſt in and vpon the Church, what you liſt: and ſo countenance thereby your Antichriſtian doctrine, when all other ſhifts faile: let vs ſee, whither this cannot yet further be made manifeſt out of him. He (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 4. cap. 14.</hi>) ſaied, <hi>that Polycarpe taught, that one and ſole trueth, which he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Apoſtles, quae &amp; Eccleſia tradit, which the Church deliuereth forth.</hi> Where of neceſſity, by thoſe things which the Church deliuereth by tradition (that he there ſpeaketh of) you may not vnderſtand any other, but thoſe which haue warrant from the word writen, and in no caſe thoſe things that are beſides that or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto: for then, hee would not haue called that which <hi>Polycarpe</hi> preached, the one and ſole trueth: for queſtionles thoſe things are true, that are conteined in the ſcriptures. And this clearely appeareth, if you marke the wordes as they are in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himſelfe, in his <hi>5.</hi> booke &amp; <hi>20. cap.</hi> that <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath relation vnto; which are theſe, <hi>Polycarpe did mention, or teach thoſe thinges, which he had heard of the Apoſtles, that is, all things agreeable to the ſcriptures.</hi> Againe the ſame <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his <hi>3.</hi> booke and <hi>3. cap.</hi> (which is one of the Chapters by you before alleadged) ſaieth, that vnder <hi>Clement,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wrought to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> ſhewing them, <hi>quam traditionem, what tradition of late they had receiued of the Apoſtles,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that God the father almighty, and ſo forth</hi> (as is expreſſed in <hi>Moyſes) is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And that he is ſo taught to bee, of the Churches</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>they that will learne, may by the Scriptures, and ſo they may vnderſtand the Apoſtolique traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.</hi> Where it is moſt cleare, that he telleth vs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that by the Apoſtolique tradition, he vnderſtandeth this ſame doctrin of God the father, which before they wrote, the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the church by liuely voice, &amp; afterward, as it appeareth, they ſet down in writing. Is this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honeſt dealing in you, to make

Howbeit, I hope, the indifferent reader by theſe teſtimonies doeth &amp; will perceiue, that you wonderfully ſeeke to abuſe Gods people, when yet you would perſwade them at anie
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18269:88"/> time, that the ancient fathers are fauourers, and patrons of your vnwriten traditions. And I truſt, this may ſerue to make it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appeare, that in the iudgement of theſe ancient fathers, your <hi>Andradius</hi> may be aſhamed, to write as he hath <hi>ſcripto ſuo aedito tempore Tridentini co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilii. That the greateſt part of Catholicke Religion is left vnto the traditions of the church not writen:</hi> and that your <hi>Lyndan</hi> was extreame mad, or very drunke, when he wrote, <hi>It is moſt extreame madnes to thinke, that the whole and entire body of Euangelicall doctrine, is to be ſearched out of the Apoſtolique letters writen with inke, &amp; out of the litle booke of the new teſtament. Panopl: lib. 1. cap. 22.</hi> But thus to make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen traditions, ſometime equall &amp; ſometime ſuperiour in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the canonical ſcripture, &amp; that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ground, that al trueth is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly taught therein, you haue learned of the <hi>Encratites, Manichees,</hi> and of the <hi>Montaniſts, Valentinians,</hi> and others, as it appeares in them, that wrote againſt them.</p>
                  <p>And yet (O good God) what a ſtir now of late this <hi>Andradius, Lyndan</hi> &amp; other ſuch your great champions haue made, &amp; what coſt they haue beſtowed, to drawe men from that eſtimation, that theſe fathers had of the authority and ſufficiencie of the canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in making large treatiſes and diſcourſes to ſhew, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therof depends of the teſtimony and authority of the church that they are not ſufficient, no not halfe ſufficient for the direction of the church, either for Religion or conuerſation; and that they are obſcure &amp; hard to be vnderſtoode, &amp; all vpon this occaſion, that will they, nil they, they are driuen to perceaue, that their opinions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ from them, cannot any longer bee defended by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for al their ſophiſtrie &amp; cunning; and that therefore they ſee they muſt maintaine the credit of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the authority of the church &amp; her vnwriten traditions, which they may ſay to be what they lift, or that elſe they muſt be driuen to throw vs the bucklers, and to run out of the field. But you doe fouly deceiue your ſelues, if you thinke in this great light, that men eſpy not, that this is a ſhamefull ſhift, and which argueth that your cauſe is euen giuing vp the ghoſt, that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold out no longer, vnles it be, by preferring the authority of the church the wife, before Chriſt the huſband; &amp; by giuing her your commiſſion to ſit as iudge ouer her huſbands word, &amp; to adde there unto, and take therefrom; how &amp; what ſeemeth good vnto her. And your fault herein is the more intollerable, becauſe by the church you

For euen children, may ſee, that you are very farre driuen, when there is no other remedy, but you muſt thus open your mouthes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your pens, to diſgrace his writen word (which all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know to be his word indeed without queſtion) for the gracing &amp; countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in this ſort of that, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> though you call his worde, you are neuer able to proue to be ſo. And for this who ſeeth not that we may iuſtly ſay of you, as <hi>Tertull: Apolog. 5.</hi> ſaied of the heathen in his time. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud vos de humano arbitratu penſitatur diuinitas, niſi homini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit; homo ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deo propitius eſſe debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> that is, with you the godhead is eſteemed of, as man ſhall thinke good; vnles God pleaſe man, he ſhall not be God, man now muſt be good to God.

This once we knowe to be his word, which wee finde ſet downe in the Canonicall ſcriptures, &amp; we are ſure this was writen by the direction of Gods Spirit, for the information of the Church. And we cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; but that this Spirit of God foreſawe, what dangerous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques there would bee, which (if they were not preuented by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word of God fully in writing) vnder the pretence of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen traditions, would bring in damnable hereſies. And therefore ſeeing it is euident vnto vs, that he in theſe writings, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to leaue inſtruction vnto vs, to ſettle vs in the certaine trueth, &amp; we know he could go thorow with it, becauſe he is God &amp; the fountain &amp; authour of all wiſedome &amp; trueth; &amp; are ſure that he was willing, becauſe he perfectly loued the church, &amp; by Chriſts promiſe, by the miniſtry of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles was to leade it into al trueth: we muſt needes thinke it flat blaſphemy, to think, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God is any way vnſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the full direction of the Church in all matters.

                  <p>IN this 6. Chapter, you cite three places though ſome of them wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g quoted out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whereby indeed it appeareth, that as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did obiect ſucceſſion, euen ſo did he, to confute the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques of his time: that taught things contrary to the ſcriptures; but as I haue ſaied vnto you, concerning <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> ſo doe I concerning him. You muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> liued &amp; wrote within 400. yeares after Chriſt: vnto whoſe time the Biſhops &amp; paſtours whoſe ſucceſſion he produceth, had continued at leaſt, ſound in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall pointes of Chriſtian Religion: from which you &amp; your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours fell away long ago, &amp; therefore that which he might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſafely and to good purpoſe doe, you cannot doe without perill, &amp; to an ill ende. Againe you muſt be told, that as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was not, ſo neither was he in thus doing a Prophet, to ſhew that to the worldes ende, it would be ſafe thus to doe. And laſtly, I would haue both you and your reader to remember, that it is not bare perſonal ſucceſſion, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> here maketh ſuch reckoning of, but that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ioyned alſo with ſucceſſion of trueth of doctrine, as it was in his time with them, of whoſe ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh, and is not now with you, and them, of whoſe ſucceſſion you brag ſo much Which three things conſidered, whatſoeuer things further by you, or any of your fellowes are alleadged to this purpoſe out of <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Cyprian,</hi> or <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (which you might haue as well alleadged, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) be anſwered. For they all of them liued within 500. yeares after Chriſt, when as yet the ſtate of the church ſtood in good tearmes, in compariſon that yours doeth: and they all ſpoke of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of perſons, ſucceeding alſo one another in the Apoſtolicke trueth, and they ſpake but for their owne times: they prophecied not that ſo it would be alwaies. And yet thus it is your faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to beguile the ſimple, that whatſoeuer you reade 1000. yeares ago ſpoken in commendation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that then was the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke church, or Catholicke faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you would beare them in hand, is ſpoken of your Romiſh church and Religion now, when as yours
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18269:90"/> compared with thoſe times, hath no ſimilitude with the Church of Chriſt then, in a great number of weighty points. But for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatiſfying of the reader, indeede S. <hi>Auguſt:</hi> (what account ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer either in theſe places here recited by you, or elſe where hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to make of perſonall ſucceſſion, or of any ſuch outward thing in the church) made more account of ſole trueth, taught only by the canonical Scriptures; then of all other things beſides. For euen in in his 165. epiſtle, which is the epiſtle (as it ſhould ſeeme) which you meant, though you quote the 365. which is more by an hundred &amp; one then there are in all: after, he ſaieth, we preſume not ſo much of theſe, as of the ſcriptures. And in the ſecond place, by you here ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of him (which ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly you ſay he calleth <hi>Epiſtola funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti,</hi> wheras he calleth none of his epiſtles ſo, but writes againſt an epiſtle of the <hi>Manichees</hi> which they ſo called, one book) in the later ende of the fourth Chapter whereof, after hee had reckoned vp the thinges which did hold him in the boſome of the Catholicke church, and might likewiſe hold any beleeuer therein, though trueth as yet did not moſt manifeſtly ſhew her ſelfe, he addeth by &amp; by, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you (ſpeaking to the <hi>Manichees) ſola perſonat veritatis pollicitatio &amp;c.</hi> onely promiſe of trueth rings; which truely if it bee ſhewed to bee on your ſide, ſo manifeſt, that it cannot be called into doubt, <hi>praeponenda eſt omnibus illis rebus, quibus in Catholicâ teneor,</hi> that is, is to bee preferred before all thoſe thinges, whereby other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I am held in the Catholicke Church.

For I finde he wrote 2. bookes againſt the aduerſarie of the lawe and the Prophets, but none in all his tomes can I finde fathered vpon him, writen, as you ſay, againſt the aduerſarie of the olde and new lawe: and if you meant the former, there being two bookes of that title, and euery one conſiſting of many Chapters, why ſpeake you thereof as though he had writen but one, and name not the Chapter: when you tell vs where to finde the place, you ſhall be more particulerly anſwered thereunto. In the meane time, you ſee in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> iudgement in the two other places, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the trueth taught in the canonical ſcriptures, is to be preferred before all other motiues to keepe a man in the true Catholique Church: contrarie whereunto I am ſure hee neither teacheth where you meane, nor any where elſe. You ſhould therefore in his opinion farre better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe

Wherein I preferre you yet before <hi>Stapleton,</hi> in that herein the trueth of the manifold inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their ſucceſſion ſeemeth to haue preuailed more with you, then with him. For he writing againſt <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> of this matter of ſucceſſion, though hee ſaieth hee will not holde ſucceſſion in the ſame places, and ſees to haue continued generally, yet in this particuler line of Popes onely, hee thinketh that ſafely

                  <p>NOw to turne vnto the taking of your accompts, maie it pleaſe you to ſhew vs, how you haue followed the ſteps of the flocke of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſel, that we gaue to his reaſonable ſheepe, as we haue ſaied before; who hath taught you the way that you doe follow? what doctours were your firſt tutors? who hath taught you, that the precious body of our Sauiour is not really in the Sacrament of the Altar? who hath taught the doctrine (or, if it be not griefe vnto you, hereſie) which you would haue vs to receiue as a Goſpell? I know before hand, that you will alleadge me Ieſus Chriſt, and his holie Apoſtles, whoſe ſteppes you doe profeſſe to follow, preaching euery where, that there is no difference betweene your Church (or, to ſay trueth, Synagogue) &amp; the church of the Apoſtles. But I pray, let me vnderſtand by what means you can ioine your ſelues vnto the Church of the Apoſtles, ſeing that<note n="a" place="margin">This is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent vntruth</note> you condemne &amp; cut off all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that haue beene &amp; are betweene you &amp; them. For to verifie this, I will alleage no other but your owne workes: for <hi>Caluin</hi> in his Inſtitutions at the Treatiſe of the Supper of the Lord, ſpeaking of the oblation of the bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt, as it was offered in olde time, he doeth write punctuallie theſe wordes: <hi>Caluinus, in ſuâ inſtitutione traditâ de Coenâ Domini. I finde</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>that thoſe of old time haue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18269:102"/> changed this faſhion, otherwiſe then the Inſtitution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did require, ſeeing that their ſupper did repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a certaine ſpectacle of a ſtrange inuention, or at the leaſt, of a new maner. There is nothing more ſure vnto the faithful, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to holde themſelues vnto the pure ordinance of the Lord, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was called a ſupper, to the ende, that onely his authority may be our rule. Yet it is true, that when I conſider their good meaning, and that their intent was, neuer to derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt, I dare not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of folly, and yet I thinke, that one cannot excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they haue not ſomewhat failed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour forme: for they haue followed more the Ceremonies of the Iews, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the order of Ieſus Chriſt did permit. And this is the point, in which they ought to be reſiſted: for they haue confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to much vnto the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not contenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the ſimple inſtitution of Chriſt, they haue to much inclined themſelues vnto the ſhadowed Ceremonies of the Iewes law.</hi>

But in Chriſtes time, I pray you tell me, whither they that beleeued that Chriſt could fulfill their deſire though abſent; or they that thought, he muſt be locally preſent, or els it would not be, had the greater faith in his omnipotencie? I am ſure you will ſay, the faith of the former was the ſtronger, and that they therein ſhewed themſelues better perſwaded of Chriſtes almightineſſe, then the later, for the euidence of the matter will enforce you to confeſſe thus much. Then to applie this to this preſent matter, the thing, that both you and wee deſire, is, truely to bee fedde with the bodie and bloud of Chriſt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: whither then doe wee or you indeede beleeue his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie better: we, that ſay and beleeue, that he can and doeth feede vs herewith, and vnite vs and himſelfe together in the vſe of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, hee tarrying ſtill in heauen according to the Scriptures; or you, that imagine, that hee cannot doe it, vnleſſe hee creepe into your mouthes, vnder the formes of bread and wine?

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18269:108"/> at this table, you will ſecke him by faith, where hee is in heauen, and not, as you doe, in the formes of bread and wine (whereunto on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your owne fanſie hath tied him) by your faith you ſhall ſo reach, and apprehend him, and hee by his ſpirit will ſo embrace you, that there was neuer head more ſurely by vienes, ſinewes, arteries and other helps of nature tied vnto the inferiour parts, nor huſband to wife, nor father to ſonne more faſt and ſurely linked and knit, by the bonds of naturall vnion, then he will vnite himſelfe vnto you. For the defence of your reall preſence, and for the auoiding of many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities concerning Chriſts manhoode, that thereby you are fallen into, you talke much of the ſtate of Chriſtes glorified body. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, doe you not ſee, that whatſoeuer you talke thereof, is quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the purpoſe? For this is not a Sacrament of his glorified bodie, but of his crucified bodie: not of the coniunction of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud, but of the ſeparation of the one from the other: and therefore Chriſt in the inſtitution, called not bread and wine ſimply his bodie and bloud, but his bodie broken and bloud ſhed, and gaue the bread a ſacrament of the one, and the wine, a part from the bread, a Sacrament of the other. Whereupon it is euident, that here we haue to doe with his paſſible body, with his bodie broken, &amp; his bloud ſhed vpon the croſſe, and not with the ſtate of his glorified and impaſſible body; and therefore vnleſſe the ſtate of his paſſible body dying vpon the croſſe, will ſtand with your reall preſence, it hath no place here. For by the very wordes of the inſtitution (which you would ſeeme otherwhiles moſt carefully and literally to vrge) it is the body broken and the bloud ſhed, that muſt here be really pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent: which otherwiſe then by faith, how can it be? ſeeing it is ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince his body was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and bloud ſhed; and ſince it hath not beene really at any time iterated, nor can be, for he died once for all, and ſo, that ſince he is not to die any more, as the ſcripture teacheth, <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> Which if you and your fellows would ſeriouſly marke, the naked and bare words of the inſtitution, would driue you from your kinde of reall preſence (which cannot be of the body broken, and bloudſhed of Chriſt now) to embrace our reall preſence thereof, thorow faith and effectuall remembrance, that they were once ſo vſed to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which is poſſible and effectuall vnto ſaluation. Thus much to anſwere your demande concerning this matter.</p>

And we are perſwaded, that this Religion, and conſequently a Church to holde and embrace it hath euer ſince vnto theſe daies continued. And we graunt you alſo, that though God for the ſinnes of his people doe afflict his Church diuers times, and that grieuouſly; as he did the Iſralites with the 70. yeares captiuity: yet then he doeth not leaue them without teachers to comfort them, and therefore in all ages and times doe conſtantly beleeue in one place or other, that this our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Church hath had ſome ſuch.

                  <p>WHat argument you ſpeake of, it is hard to tell ſeeing as yet (for any thing that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiue) you vttered nothing ſince you entered into this matter, to call vs to an account of our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, worthie the name of an argument. Indeed that which loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you haue vttered here and there againſt it, of the neceſſity of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of perſons, and of impoſition of handes (as you imagine) we muſt ſay indeede, take place in an ordinary calling, and not alwaies in an extraordinary. But by your ſpeach it ſhould ſeeme, you had relation to ſome thing, which you took to be an argument, ſet downe in the laſt Chapter before this; where in effect you haue ſaied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but onely in your ſcoffing maner found fault with vs, becauſe in ſetting downe the ill liues of your prelates, on the one ſide of the leafe, we ſet not downe on the other ſide the good liues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our own: which how it ſhould ſeeme to containe an argument, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ordinary, or extraordinary vocation, I ſee not. For neither they that are called the one way or the other; are alwaies bound to obſerue that order. But to let your pitiful logicke go, and to paſſe ouer your ſcoffing in calling vs Gods Commiſſaries not worthy an anſwere, let vs ſee, if you haue hit of any better argument here to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18269:115"/> proue our miniſters not to haue beene extraordinarily by God ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vp to correct the ſuperſtitious liues, and doctrine of the papiſtes Idolaters (as you ſaie, we tearme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) then as yet you haue brought to diſproue their ordinary calling. If we would come to plead this matter with you (you ſay) you would aide your ſelues herein againſt vs with a Syllogiſme of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. which is this. <hi>Hee that is of God doeth obey the word of God: but you doe not obey the word of God, therefore ye are not of God.</hi> You ſuppoſe that we will denie your minor, and therefore in that God commaundeth <hi>Matthew.</hi> 22. <hi>to giue vnto Ceſar, that which is Ceſars, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God that which is Gods:</hi> and our miniſters doe neither of theſe, but the contrary, in deteyning <hi>Geneua</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy,</hi> and in being the cauſes of the ſtirres in <hi>France,</hi> and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your biſhops and Prieſts of their liuings, you thinke that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo againſt them, that the concluſion muſt needs follow. Doe you thinke in earneſt, that whoſoeuer can be proued in anie one thing to diſobey God, ſtreight thereupon it followeth, that his commiſſion or calling is not of God? What man euer was there either ordinarilie or extraordinarilie called to anie office (except the man Chriſt Ieſus) but in ſome one thing or other, at one time or other, one waie or other hee did not obey God? Seeing that all men are ſinners, and there is not one that can truely ſay, his heart and handes haue alwaies beene free from ſinne, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion of the law of God. Take Chriſtes words in this ſence, and ſo none, no not hee amongſt you, that is fulleſt of his workes of Supererogation ſhall euer eſcape this concluſion. If you had viewed the text, you ſhould haue perceiued, that Chriſt vſeth that ſpeach againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> who blaſphemed the doctrine of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and would abide neither to heare, nor to obey it, and not generallie againſt all that in anie thing are found at anie time diſobedient to God of ignorance, or infirmitie. And yet though he had ment ſo, and it were graunted, that euery man in that hee offendeth, or ſinneth, is not therein of God: yet thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it followeth not, that the ſame man therefore cannot be a man, that hath his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion or calling of God. <hi>Dauid</hi> was not of God, in that he committed adultery with <hi>Berſhebah,</hi> and murdered <hi>Vrias,</hi> yet euen then hee had a commiſſion of God, and a calling to bee King ouer his people. And therefore though you could proue theſe thinges to be true that you charge our miniſters withal, and though
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18269:116"/> alſo it were graunted, that therein they haue done ill: yet thereupon neceſſarily it doeth not follow, that therefore they were not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſtirred vp by God, to correct your ſins, and abhominations, For <hi>Iehu,</hi> whom God vndoubtedly ſtirred vp to chaſtiſe the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and to correct the Idolatrous prieſtes of <hi>Baal,</hi> euen with an extraordinarie zeale 2. <hi>King.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. yet he departed not from the ſins of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> which made <hi>Iſraell</hi> to ſinne, as there it appeareth. Againe, it is ſtrange that you ſhould lay theſe as faults, yea as ſuch faults to our miniſters charge, as that therefore they cannot be ſent of God, when as not onely it is a receiued, taught &amp; printed doctrine amongſt you in the 5.

For this your doctrine and practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, if your argument for the cauſes by you alleadged (ſuppoſing that they were true) haue any force againſt our miniſters, it hath ten times aſmuch force againſt yours, whoſe chiefeſt meane of late to eſtabliſh and continue your kingdome, hath beene (as the ſtories of all countries for this 600. or 700. yeares at the leaſt doe make it moſt manifeſt) by force and ſubtlety to bend and frame Kings and their kingdomes, either to be at your deuotion, or els to make a ſpoile of them, and their kingdomes for your ſelues and your frends. If therefore there had beene either ſhame or common diſcretion in you, you would neuer haue vſed this argument againſt vs, which maketh more ſtrongly againſt your ſelues.</p>
                  <p>But in deed and trueth, the things, that you ground your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt vs, are partly vntrue, and partly maliciouſly wre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſted onely againſt our miniſters.

And as for the troubles in <hi>France,</hi> it appeareth by the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, that they haue proceeded firſt from your owne ſide, and that the doings of the proteſtant Princes there, haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes beene iuſtified, euen by the Kings owne edictes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to haue beene done in all loialty: and that their warres haue beene but defenſiue againſt the oppreſſions offered them (contrary both to the ancient lawes, and preſent edictes of the Land) by certayne ambitious perſons, and not offenſiue either to the Kings perſon, or dignity. And as for your Biſhops and Prieſtes (of whoſe being driuen from their lyuings by our men, you complayne ſo much) in ſome ſorte I confeſſe, thorow their occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, they haue beene diſpoſſeſſed thereof, but that ſeditiouſly or tumultuouſly, by force they haue beene driuen there from by them, we vtterly deny. For in moſt places, they haue beene diſpoſſeſſed thereof by mature deliberation, and conſideration of the badnes of their titles thereunto, in ſolemne and lawfull aſſemblyes of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the countries, by the lawfull authority of the ſame eſtats: as namely here with vs, in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, where the Goſpell is receiued and eſtabliſhed by publique authority: and by the ſame authority orderly our men (whoſe right thereunto in thoſe aſſemblyes and Parliamentes haue beene founde to be the better) haue beene put into poſſeſſion thereof. And in other places, your Biſhops and Prieſtes, as not able to ſtand in the preſence of the light of the Goſpell, when, will they, nill they, they ſawe it would take place in their territories, forſooke their places, and left them to thoſe that had more right thereunto, as for example, they did in <hi>Geneua,</hi> when the Goſpell was firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there. And no marueile, though vpon the bare preaching of Gods trueth, and the entertainment thereof, many of your proude Biſhops, and ſuperſtitious Prieſtes can ſtand no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18269:117"/> that the proude prelates, of your Antichriſtian <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto themſelues titles and offices, through the ambitious and fond deuiſe of mens heads, which God neuer allowed to be for his houſe, muſt needes (when God meaneth to reforme his houſe, and to eſtabliſh his owne orders therein) auaunte their roomes, and leaue their liuinges, for the Lordes true officers, and allowed ſeruantes indeede. Blame therefore the badneſſe of your foundation and title, for leeſing of your liuings, and nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>You bid vs ſhew our euidence, that our right to them is better then yours, out of the ancient doctours. In the meane tyme you apply <hi>Tertullians</hi> wordes, in his booke of Preſcription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heretiques againſt vs, and that of <hi>Paul, How ſhall they preach, vnleſſe they bee ſent? Romans.</hi> 10. I anſwere you: not onely out of the ancient doctours, but out of the Canonicall Scriptures alſo, our miniſters long ago haue made euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration vnto the Princes and eſtates, that haue driuen you out of poſſeſſion, and put them in, that their title to your liuings was good, and yours ſtarke naught; in that thereby they proued vnto them, their religion to be ancient, ſound, and Apoſtolique, and yours to be but of a later Antichriſtian ſtampe: though you (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your maner) ſay we cannot deny, but that your religion was planted throughout Chriſtendome 1000. yeares, before wee were borne: which you ſhall neuer be able to proue true: for wee moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deny, both that antiquity, and vniuerſality of it. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you will, wee are ready againe by the ſame Scriptures, and Doctours, to proue our right by the ſame argument to bee good and ſound, and yours to be of no force: come to the triall of it, when, and as oft as you will. And therefore, ſeeing it is a thing moſt euident, that the reaſon why either you or we ſhould pretend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie right to theſe, or any other liuinges of the Church, is, that we feede the Church with wholeſome and ſounde doctrine; wee hauing oft proued ours ſo to be, by the grounds aforeſaied, and you being neuer able to doe the like for yours, both <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, and <hi>Tertullians</hi> muſt rather take place againſt you, then vs. For I truſt you will confeſſe, that there <hi>Paul</hi> accounteth none ſent of God to preach, but thoſe that preach the truth; and queſtionles <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> vſeth thoſe words of his (as by the wordes themſelues, as they are ſet downe by you, it is euident) not againſt thoſe, that were
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18269:117"/> able to proue their doctrine ſounde by the Apoſtles writings, but againſt fantaſticall heretiques, ſuch as had taught, and did teach doctrine diſſonant from the Scriptures, deuiſed vpon their owne heades. Againſt whom he being to preſcribe, both by the Scriptures, and by the ſounde teſtimony of thoſe, that ſucceeded the Apoſtles vntill his tyme, he might lawfully and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſay, <hi>what are yee, and from whence doe you come &amp;c.</hi> And truely, when any man ſhall enter into a conſideration of the ſtate of the Church in <hi>Tertullians</hi> tyme, both in reſpect of doctrine and gouernment: and on the one ſide weigh the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the paſtours and teachers then, and the agreement that their doctrine had with the writen word, and then therewith on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, compareth the more then princely prelacy and <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> that hath beene theſe many yeares, and yet is in yours, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with doctrine not only manifoldly differing, but in a number of points, directly contrarying the word writen: hee ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to thinke, that if <hi>Tertullian</hi> were aliue againe, and ſawe notwithſtanding how confidently you ruffle, as though all were yours, and no man had any right to any thing, but your ſelues; he would more vehemently vſe theſe words here recited by you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your prelates, then euer he did againſt <hi>Marcion, Apelles,</hi> or any other heretique in his time.</p>
                  <p>But you are ſo liberall vnto vs, as to tell vs, <hi>that though wee had commiſsion from God, yet he would haue called it backe, euen for our noble actes and deedes, in driuing you out of poſſeſsion, and taking poſſeſsion, though of our own, before the ſentence of the iudge was giuen.</hi> Which you proue by a law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Arcades</hi> Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> made to forbid men, vnder paine of leeſing their right, not to ſeeke to recouer poſſeſſion of their own, by violence &amp; force. Wherunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you, that graunt vs ſo much (which of right you muſt) and for all your tale and penall Statute of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Arcades,</hi> we ſhall be to good for you. For firſt, what other Iudges ſentence were wee to expect, but theirs, that we had on our ſide alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die? Secondly, there hath beene no ſuch tumultuous, or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly violence vſed by vs (as I haue ſhewed before) as their lawe forbiddeth, to recouer our owne from you: and then you muſt vnderſtand, that theſe Emperours preſcribe their lawe, to bridle men, and not to binde God from recouering his inheritance to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18269:118"/> the vſe of his ſeruants, from the hands of Antichriſtian vſurpers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by force and violence, if otherwiſe they will not yeeld. To proue therefore, that God would haue called in our commiſſion, though he had graunted it, rather then hee would haue ſuffred vs to execute it, in violent driuing you out of poſſeſſion, to recouer our owne right, you had neede to haue vſed a ſtronger reaſon, then taken from the edict of Emperours. If theſe thinges had beene well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered before of you, you might haue ſpared your ieſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you conclude this Chapter well enough, and ſo rather haue ſtaied your pipes your ſelfe, then in ſuch ſorte, as you haue, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſo ioyfully in token of triumph, before any likelihoode of victory. The vanity and falſhoode of your bragge, for the continuance of your religion aboue one thouſand yeares, before we were borne, not onely throughout <hi>France,</hi> but alſo throughout all Chriſtendome, I haue fully and at large diſcouered in the later ende of the preface, &amp; in my anſwer to your 4.16. &amp; 39. <hi>ca.</hi> &amp; therfore in this place I haue ſaied no more then I haue, referring the reader for a full anſwere thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to both here, and whereſoeuer elſe it is repeated by you, vnto theſe places. And though <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſay, as you write, that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and licence of conſcience to doe euil, is the death of the ſoule: yet that toucheth vs nothing at al, for doing what we may, by lawfull &amp; ordinary means, to diſpoſſeſſe your Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prelats of the places of gouernment ouer Chriſts Church, and of the maintenance due to his true &amp; faithful paſtors. For ſo to deale, is but orderly to recouer Gods inheritance out of the hands of his enemies, &amp; to poſſeſſe them thereof, to whom it is due, and therefore in ſo doing, there is neither liberty nor licence to doe euil practiſed. But rather you, in crauing the reſtoring of you thereunto, and quiet continuance therein ſtill, craue both liberty &amp; licence, without controlement to go on in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious enioying that, which at no hand appertaines to ſuch as you be.</p>

Euerie one doeth know, that the adminiſtration of iuſtice is verie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable before God, and that there be manie in this vocation, that would not for anie thing doe anie wrong, vnto the widow and fatherleſſe childe: &amp; yet we ſee and know by experience, that there are manie others that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie conſcience, doe take bribes and offer wrong, both to the fatherleſſe &amp; to the widow, the which crimes are no leſſe in that eſtate, then the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe liuing of the Biſhops and Paſtors.

                  <p>NOT we, but your Romiſh Ieſuites and ſeminary Prieſts, are the ſowers of that ſeede of ſedition, that you ſpeake of; neither is it we, but they and ſuch like of your ſide, which when they haue ſo done, alleadge onely for their defence, their ardent and Apoſtolique zeale and affection to winne ſoules. This, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> theſe late yeares, hath notoriouſly and very often beene found true in theſe, and queſtionleſſe other kingdomes, where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached and eſtabliſhed, haue and doe finde the like. For they go vp and downe ſecretly, vnder the pretence of reconciling men and women, into the boſom of their mother Church, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate their heartes from their naturall ſoueraigne, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a forraine potentate, and ſo prepare them againſt the time when opportunity ſhal beſt ſerue, to procure the death or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their lawfull Prince. And that thus without anie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God they maie doe, they perſwade themſelues by vertue of the Popes bull, in that therein they bee abſolued from their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance vnto their home ſupreme magiſtrate, and are thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taught, that in furthering either his depriuation or death, they ſhal doe honourable, acceptable and meritorious ſeruice to the mother church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe thinges (I ſay) haue of late yeares too too often here in <hi>England,</hi> in open places of iudgement beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proued againſt your Ieſuites and Popiſh Prieſtes, and therefore as traitours a number of them and their followers, haue beene moſt worthely executed. Which thinges being ſo euident as they are, great ſhame is it, that yet you ſhould not bluſh to charge vs with theſe thinges, whereof yours are moſt famouſly guilty, and whereof truely you cannot conuict any of ours. You tell vs wee ſhould haue praied to the Lorde of the harueſt, to thruſt forth more labourers thereinto (as Chriſt hath commanded vs <hi>Math.</hi> 9. and not as you quote it <hi>Math.</hi> 15.) and that in the meane time we ſhould haue reformed our ſelues, and not haue taken vpon vs without ſome expreſſe commaundement from God, a matter of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

According to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Chriſt, wee haue praied to the Lorde of the harueſt, and he, in his mercy towardes his Church, hath heard our prayers, and wee hope will euery day more and more, to the full ouerthrowe of yours, and perfect conſummation of ours. But that in the meane time, they, whoſe eies God hath opened to ſee the Babyloniſh confuſion of yours, ſhould there haue ſtaied (as you would haue had them) vntill they had a further commiſſion from God then already they had (for ſo you muſt needes meane by that further commiſſion or expreſſe commaundement, that you would haue had them firſt to haue had) you can neuer proue. For they, whoſe miniſtrie it pleaſed God to vſe to detect your Antichriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings according to his worde 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. in theſe later daies were ſuch, as namely, <hi>Wickliffe, Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> that had not onely the ordinary calling of thoſe times to feede Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as paſtours and doctours, but alſo they were ſuch as God had bleſſed with rare and extraordinary giftes of knowledge and zeale, and therefore if they ſeeing the abhominations of your Synagogue, and the groſſe blindeneſſe and errours that you ſtill laboured to holde Gods people in, had contented themſelues one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with praying vnto God for the redreſſe therof, &amp; with reforming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; had not ſaied their hands &amp; ſhoulders to the work, vſing the talents that God had beſtowed vpon them, to his beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, without a further new and expreſſe commaundement, then they had alreadie receiued in the writen word, ſhould not they with the vnprofitable ſeruant <hi>Math.</hi> 25. haue had their wages? They tooke not in hand to doe as they did (as you would make your Reader beleeue) onely vnder the colour of zeale, without expreſſe warrant from God their Lorde and maſter For beſide their zeale and knowledge, by their callinges in that they were famous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and paſtours in their times, they were bound by Gods expreſſe worde <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.1. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. and in ſundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places to doe, as they did. But to bring vs and our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters into hatred, in this Chapter you labour to perſwade your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as of burning zeale they haue in many places diſpoſſeſſed your Biſhops and Prieſtes of their places, ſo as Gods Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and as men voide of all partiality (for thus tauntingly it pleaſeth you to write) they wil proceede againſt ciuill magiſtrates, both higher and lower in like maner, becauſe many of them haue
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18269:121"/> beene and be (as you ſay) as ill liuers and rather worſe, then your Popiſh Prelates haue beene. Which to bee an vnlawfull thing and the cauſe of all confuſion and horrible diſorder, you beſtowe a great deale of needeleſſe paines to proue, for it is a thing that wee teach and vrge in earneſt, and you (your practiſe to the contrary beeing ſo vſuall as it is conſidered) onely in ieſt, and for a faſhion teach it. But indeede this is the way, which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and ancient enemies of Gods Church haue alwaies vſed, to diſgrace the true ſeruants of God by, with the Kings and Princes of the world, and therefore you doe well in that you are nothing behinde them, in malice &amp; enmity againſt Gods people, in that you ſtudie alſo to be like them in this. Wee reade (you know) after the returne of Gods people out of their captiuitie in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they beganne once to build and to go forward, either with Gods houſe in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or the walles of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, alwaies this was one of the practiſes of their enemies to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour their diſcredit, to the hinderance of their worke, to accuſe them to the Perſian Kings, to intende therein ſedition and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt them. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this practiſe die, when the common weale of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ceaſed, for it appeares in <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Apology in ſundry places, that there was nothing more common in the primatiue Church, then to lay to the charge of the Chriſtians, that they conſpired amongſt themſelues againſt the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and the ciuill and ſupreme magiſtrates thereof. And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18269:121"/> therefore we can the more patiently abide this your dealing with vs, in that herein we ſee we are no otherwiſe dealt withall by you, then Gods people, Chriſt his Apoſtles, and other his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue beene dealt withall in ancient time, by your predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.

Yea this wee dare bee bolde to ſay, that the Chriſtian Kings, Princes and magiſtrates, that haue giuen beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto it, finde by moſt manifeſt experience, that both it and the profeſſours therof, haue better eſtabliſhed them in their thrones, and more aduanced them in their dignities, then euer they were or could be by yours. For now they are abſolute Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according to their right, where as yours made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold their kingdomes, as the Popes vaſſals, and ſo but at the curteſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of a forrainer, and of an intollerable proud and vnſatiable v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping Prelate: and now their treaſure is kept at home to the ſtrengthening greatly of their kingdomes and dominions, which by your Romiſh Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; gouernment, was woont a 1000. waies moſt inſatiably in infinit quantity yearly, to the wonderfull weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, to be conueied to <hi>Rome.</hi> And whereas then by meanes of your auricular confeſſion, the ſecrets of euery Prince where that was vſed, was often to the great peril of their ſtates made knowen, to many &amp; vndiſcreet blabs &amp; by them &amp; their means to their forreine head the Pope, and ſo he was thereby alwaies the better inabled for the furtherance of his owne deuiſes, to preuent &amp; croſſe theirs: by the baniſhing of that Romiſh ſtratageme Princes cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels &amp; ſecrets, are kept at home in ſecret as they ſhould, to the great good of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; their cuntries. And laſtly, by our Religion, according to the examples of <hi>Dauid, Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Ezechias, Ioſiah, Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> they are in poſſeſſion of their full authority, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; in matters eccleſiaſtical, aſwel their ſubiects of the cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gy as the reſt; whereas by your Religion they were ſupreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vnder God for matters ciuil only, &amp; had their cleargy ſo exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18269:122"/> from them and their iuriſdiction, that howſoeuer they had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their kingdomes to enioy the promotions thereof, they had neither their bodies nor ſoules in further ſubiection, then would ſtand with the pleaſure and profit of the forraine potentate the Pope. By meanes whereof, <hi>Anſelme, Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lanckton, Thomas Becket</hi> and ſundry other proude prelates of this land, haue ſo ſtucke to the Pope, againſt their ſoueraigne kings at home here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that in compariſon of the Pope, they haue ſet their King at naught, to the wonderfull trouble and diſquiet of the whole land, as notoriouſly appeares in our Cronicles. Which things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I thinke you may long tell Princes, that you and your religion is frendly to them, and that we and ours is hurtful vnto them, before any of them, that be wiſe, beleeue you. Truely I cannot but wonder at your groſſe hypocriſie in this Chapter, in that you are ſo earneſt and buſie, not onely to proue it vnlawful and mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous, how bad ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they that be in authority be, to refuſe to yeelde duety &amp; ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto them, but alſo to lay to our charge, that we haue an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to place and diſplace ciuill magiſtrates at our pleaſure. For I cannot perſwade my ſelfe, that your ſkill in diuinity was ſo ſmall, but you were reſolued for all this, that the obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection taught in theſe places here quoted by you, or any where elſe in the ſcriptures, is not ſo infinite and abſolute, as that thereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects are bound to doe whatſoeuer by higher powers, be it good or bad, they are commanded to doe. For how could it be poſſible, that a man of your place ſhould forget the vſual limitation, in the Lord, or that you ſhould not remember that God muſt be obeied before man. Neither yet can I thinke, that you were ignorant, but that the very ſame thing which here you charge vs with, as with a grieuous fault, hath bene and yet is openly practiſed, and taught publickly, to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawfull in your Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hereof I am ſure <hi>D. Allen,</hi> a great man of your ſide, in his 5 Chapter of his defence of Engliſh catholicks, recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vp in a great brauery and bragge, ſundry Kings and Emperours by force depoſed by the Pope. And indeed it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt euidently in ſundry Chronicles, that at their pleaſure, a long time they haue moſt ſhamefully miſuſed Chriſtian Princes &amp; potentates of the world. For though they were and are beholden to the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, for their firſt aduancement, from the ſtate of poore perſecuted biſhops, to the ſtate of patriarches in theſe weſterne parts, yet in proceſſe of tyme, when the ſeat of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18269:122"/> was remooued to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; theſe weſterne parts were gouerned by an exarch at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> they through the help of certaine Kings of the <hi>Lombards</hi> and others, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thankefulneſſe to the ancient Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> quite extinguiſhed their Empire and authority in theſe weſt parts. And in the ende, not contented with that, which they had incroched by the ruine of the Empire, through the helpe of the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Lombards</hi> &amp; others (ſeeking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their further adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cement) Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> about the yeare 743. found the meanes to cauſe <hi>Childericke</hi> then King of <hi>France,</hi> to bee depoſed, and he ſet vp <hi>Pipine</hi> in his roome, whom he &amp; his ſucceſſour <hi>Stephen</hi> the 2. aduanced to the Empire, and therefore this <hi>Pipine, Charles</hi> the great and <hi>Lodouicke</hi> his ſonne (which three immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded one another, in the new Empire, thus tranſlated vnto them by the Pope) to gratify the Pope for the ſame, they brought the <hi>Lombards</hi> and others, that before beganne to be ſomewhat to ſauſie with the Popes, vnder, and beſtowed vpon his ſee, as <hi>Blondus</hi> &amp; <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateran</hi> note, very many rich and great Ilands, cities, countries, ſhires, townes and prouinces, whereby he was mightely aduanced. Yet for all theſe great benefits receaued by the line of <hi>Pipine,</hi> when his ſucceſſours began not to be pliable enough (as they thought) to their becke, in making warre againſt the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pinch them for their wrong-gotten goods, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fifth about the yeare 1002. practiſeth with the <hi>Germans,</hi> to bring the Empire to them, from the line of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo <hi>Otho</hi> was ſet vp Emperour. But when theſe German Emperours began to abridge them of their wil, and to reſiſt their tyrannicall oppreſſions, then they laboured &amp; practiſed by all meanes, to hamper them alſo: in ſo much that certaine it is, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. excommunicated <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. or as ſome write 3. about the year 1078. &amp; gaue his empire to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph,</hi> who miſſing of it &amp; being ſlain, the Emperour yet to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the Pope, waited 3. daies &amp; 3. nights in the winter, with his wife and child at the gates of <hi>Canoſſus,</hi> and within the ſuburbes thereof, barefoote &amp; barelegged, before he could come to the ſpeech of the Pope, when he had obteined that, then he was faine to kiſſe his foote, and to yeelde vp his crowne into his hands, &amp; to take it againe vpon ſuch conditions, as it pleaſed him to preſcribe, and yet his ſucceſſour <hi>Paſcalis</hi> raged againſt the ſame Emperour againe, &amp; ſet vp his owne naturall ſonne <hi>Henry,</hi> to depriue his father of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Who when he had got it, yet he was in the ende accurſed and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18269:123"/> excommunicated by that Romiſh ſee, as his father had beene, and not preuailing ſufficiently that way, the <hi>Saxons</hi> at laſt were ſet vp to warre againſt him and depoſe him. And thus they hauing hampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe two <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ries,</hi> vnto <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> came, which was about the yeare 1155. they did what they liſted, who beganne ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againe to abridge them of their vſurped ſupremacy, and ſo did his ſons ſonne <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2. but in the ende <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, brought the necke of the firſt vnder his feete in S. <hi>Marks</hi> church in <hi>Venice,</hi> and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> controlde him from holding his wrong ſtirrop, &amp; excommunicated him for being ſo ſaucy, as to ſet his name in writing before his; and the other was miſerably vexed, by <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the 3. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9. and <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. For the firſt of theſe interdicted him, the ſecond excommunicated him twiſe, &amp; raiſed the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt him; and the third did in the end ſpoile him of his Empire, cauſed him to be poiſoned, and at length ſtrangled by one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fredus.

Now theſe thinges conſidered, and they beeing moſt true (as from point to point, they are teſtified by your owne Cronicles) if there had beene any ſhame in you, you would neuer haue gone about as you haue, to charge vs with your ſurmiſed intention to diſplace ciuill magiſtrates. Whereas you would ſeeme to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this your malicious accuſation, in that we haue diſplaced ſome of your Popiſh Biſhops, Prieſtes, Monkes, and Friers, and refuſe obedience and ſubmiſſion to your Popes: you muſt vnderſtand that herein you commit two great and foule faults; the firſt is, that you ſtretch the places here quoted by you, which teach indeed only obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubmiſſion to ciuill magiſtrates, and to lawfull eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons, in the Lorde, as though therein and thereby God had aſwell tied and bound al perſons, to obedience and ſubiection, to your vnlawfull and Antichriſtian Prelates and cleargie, yea and that in ſuch ſtrict maner, as though it were vnlawfull how bad and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoeuer they and their commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be, either to refuſe to obey them, or to ſpeake any hard word againſt them: your ſecond fault is, that you take it, that there is no difference to be put betwixt your ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Prelacies, and the higher powers, that the ſcriptures in theſe places teach obedience and ſubmiſſion vnto: whereas indeede there is as great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as there is betwixt heauen and earth, and the ordinances of God and the vnlawfull deuiſes of man, betwixt the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18269:124"/> higher powers there ſpoken for, &amp; the higher powers that you plead ſo much for. For the higher powers there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for, be ſuch as though ſometimes for iuſt cauſes knowen vnto God, they light in the hands of wicked and profane perſons, yet of themſelues are the lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of God, whereas the authority of your Popes &amp; of other your Romiſh Prelates, whom we haue diſplaced, and refuſe to ſubmit our ſelues vnto, is vtterly vnlawful, and not onely without warrant from the lord in his word, but directly contrary to the ſame. For whereas <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> 4. the ſpirit of God hath reckoned vp all the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical officers, which Chriſt the maſter of the houſe hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the ful and perfect ordering therof, none of theſe of yours, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue diſplaced and refuſe to obey, are once remembred, &amp; beſides both contrary to Chriſt our ſauiours expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; <hi>Peters</hi> alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. they take vpon them, as tyrannially as euer did any Princes of the nations, Lordſhip ouer Gods inheritance, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their proceedings we finding them to be very antichriſtian, both S. <hi>Pauls</hi> propheſie, that Antichriſt ſhall be conſumed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Gods mouth 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and that flat commandement giuen vs from heauen <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. to come out from <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; to ſeperate our ſelues from her, doe aſſure vs, that lawfully wee may ſpeake againſt them and their enormities, and not only refuſe ſubmiſſion vnto them, but alſo to doe what we can to roote out ſuch plants, which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father neuer pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, out of the earth.

For though he were a wicked tyrant, yet his authority it ſelfe was lawfull, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinance of God; and he came vnto his authority ouer the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by force of armes &amp; conqueſt, which is an ordinary way, that God vſeth to inueſt Kings and Emperours, with ſuch ciuill authority ouer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cuntries by, whereas the very authority it ſelfe of your Popes and other Prelates (howſouer you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently, and yet vntruly aduouch that <hi>S. Paul Rom.</hi> 13. is to bee vnderſtoode, aſwell to haue ſpoken that which he there ſpeaketh of them, as of Kings &amp; other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full magiſtracies &amp; offices) is as I haue proued vtterly vnlawful, and the meanes whereby they haue come thereunto, hath beene ſhameles wreſting of the ſcriptures, fraud, deceit, treachery &amp; maine force, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> all are abhominable ſteps, for cleargy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to attaine vnto their offices
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18269:125"/> by: neither would we, if we had liued vnder the perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Rome, or vnder <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> (as you here inſinuate) haue refuſed to yeelde ſo far obedience and ſubmiſſion vnto them, in all quietnes, as we might, not diſobeying the Lorde to obey them; and further, neither the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder the one, nor the Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other, were bound: which obedience and ſubmiſſion to your Popes &amp; Prelates will not ſerue your turne, for you would haue it yeelded vnto them without limitation, for otherwiſe they ſhould not be obeyed, wherein you would faineſt haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obeyed. And therefore in your Canon law <hi>diſt.</hi> 40. <hi>cap. Sipapa:</hi> it is enacted, that though your Popes ſhould deale neuer ſo lewdly, both in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and in carying others by heaps vnto hell, yet none muſt be ſo preſumptuous, as to aſke them, why they doe ſo. Howbeit for the more full ſatiſfying the Reader, and clearing our ſelues of this your ſlanderous accuſation, of intending the diſplacing of ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, for their wicked liues, this further is the common and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued doctrine amongſt vs, concerning that point: that though Chriſtian ſubiects may not diſobey God, to obey their wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, yet they are rather patiently to ſuffer the penalties that they ſhal inflict vpon them, for their chuſing rather to obey God then them, then to vſe or to conſent to the vſing of any forcible meanes to depoſe them. And this our practiſe hath plentifully made to appeare, to bee the common and receaued opinion in this caſe amongſt vs. But whereas you would haue vs ſo humble and meeke (by abuſing and wreſting Chriſtes counſell giuen vs <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.) as that we ſhould obey <hi>Pilate, Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> euen to the ſuffering of death, without once opening our lippes, to ſpeake anie word of diſgrace againſt them: I ſee the onely marke you ſhoote at is, that we ſhould obey your Popes &amp; Prelates in whatſoeuer they commande vs, or elſe that we ſhould ſuffer them, without once mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt them, to make what hauocke of vs they liſt. For though you would ſeeme to plead for our obedience &amp; ſubmiſſion to the ciuill magiſtrates, yet plainely you bewray, that ſo your Popes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates might get this ſubmiſſion at our hands, you haue the thing you ſhoote at and care for. But to returne to your perſwaſion of vs to be meeke and humble &amp;c. tell me in good earneſt, did Chriſt at any time obey any of them you ſpeake of, in any thing that was ill? and was there not a neceſſity in regard of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption to ſuffer thoſe things which he ſuffered, and as he ſuffered them at their hands? what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18269:125"/> this then, either to binde vs to obey the wicked &amp; vngodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of your Popes and Prelates, wherein onely we refuſe to liſten vnto them, or needeleſly to ſuffer thoſe thinges at your hand, which lawfully we may auoide? And I truſt you are perſwaded, that Chriſt himſelfe that willed others to learne of him to be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble and meeke, that he neuer forgat that leſſon himſelfe. And yet if you reade <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. you ſhall finde, that he compriſing the high Prieſtes themſelues within the compaſſe of his ſpeech, aſwell as other his inferiour malitious enemies, calleth them hypocrits, children of the Deuill &amp;c. And the Prophets though they were not to learne of you, how to behaue them ſelues to higher powers, yet they did vſe often very ſharpe and bitter ſpeeches, againſt the Princes and other rulers of their times; an example whereof you haue <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.10. in theſe wordes. <hi>Heare the word of the Lord O Princes of Sodom: hearken to the law of our God, O people of Gomorrah.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> you will ſay <hi>Act.</hi> 23. hauing called a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked high Prieſt, that contrary to law tyrannouſly had commanded him to be ſmitten, painted wall, being admoniſhed thereof, corrects himſelfe, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that it is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>thou ſhalt not raile or ſpeake ill of the Prince, Ex.</hi> 22. ſaying <hi>I knew not that he was the high Prieſt.</hi> Indeede one of the high Prieſts clawbacks, who are alwaies ready to iuſtify their maſter, how vniuſtly ſoeuer he deale, and to controle Gods ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for ſaying neuer ſo litle amiſſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though therunto they be neuer ſo iuſtly prouoked, gaue him a check therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it ſeemeth that <hi>Paul</hi> vpon the reaſon aforeſaied excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but indeede he did it in ſuch ſort, as that in trueth he giue, him a greater blow, though ſomewhat more couertly, then he had done before, in plainly ſhewing that, (that dealing of his conſidered) he knew him not to be the high Prieſt. But if this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you thinke ſtill, that <hi>Paul</hi> would not giue any harde ſpeech to ſuch a Prelate, and iuſtifie it when he had done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a little what reckoning you make of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and then call to remembrance, what is writen <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and you ſhall finde it cleare, that not onely he rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> openly at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but that alſo he iuſtifies that his owne doing therein, ſaying, that he did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he went not with the right foote to the Goſpell. And learne by theſe places not to be ſo dainty ouer your Popes and Prelates hereafter, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they doe lewdly, think it may well ſtand with that meekenes &amp; humility, that Chriſt hath taught vs, that they be plainly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18269:126"/> as they deſerue, tolde of their doings by vs. It is one thing to rafle of them, that be in lawful authority, and to backbite and depraue them; and another thing it is, by way of inſtruction, admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by plaine, iuſt and true tearms, to let them ſee their faults, ſo it be done in time and place conuenient, &amp; in maner beſeeming ſuch an action. This later might the <hi>Iewes</hi> doe to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Ieremies</hi> words, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours to them, and yet both keep within duety and loial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the former is that which is vnlawful to bee vſed againſt any, how bad ſoeuer he be, that is in place of lawfull magiſtracy or office. Finally, whereas you yet thinke ſcorne, that your Pope ſhould bee worſe then <hi>Nabuchadnezzar:</hi> and that therefore the <hi>Iewes</hi> might haue had far more iuſt exceptions againſt him, to free them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their obedience and ſubmiſſion to him, then we haue to free vs from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to your Popes, in trueth, therein you are very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For firſt, his authority, as a King ouer them, was a power in it ſelfe lawful, though abuſed by him; and yours (as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is flatly vnlawfull: and the <hi>Iewes</hi> were commanded ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto him; and we are commanded (as I haue ſaied) <hi>Reuel.</hi> 18. to forſake all communion with your Popiſh Antichriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Your Popes for lewdnes of life, for manifold Idolatries, and blaſphemies in Religion, and for want of right title to the dignity and office which they claime, doubtleſſe will thorowly match him, &amp; by how much their knowledge, in reſpect of the meanes they haue which he lackt, ſhould be more then his: by ſo much theſe things in them, make them more intolerable, then the ſame could make him. And therefore theſe thinges conſidered, the obedience and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Iews</hi> were enioyned to yeeld to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth not the like to be due to your Popes and other your Romiſh Prelates.</p>

                  <p>YOu proceede, charging vs to haue begon reformation by force, but as yet you haue not proued it. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning thereof, in theſe later daies, or not long after, wee graunt ſome ſtirres did ariſe in <hi>Germanie, France</hi> and other places, but therein it hath fallen out no otherwiſe with the renuing and reuiuing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, then it fell out with the Apoſtles when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne firſt to preach it. For we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 17.19. that then ſtirres and tumults there were vſually rayſed vp, by the enemies thereof to hinder the courſe thereof. And as long as it is not to bee lookt for, but that alwaies it will haue ſome enemies, what elſe can be hoped for, but when it ſpringeth &amp; beginneth to floriſh there wil be ſome ſtirres and contentions betwixt, the frendes and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18269:127"/> enemies thereof? But as the Apoſtles when for theſe ſtirs ſake they were charged to be ſeditious perſons, might truely cleare them ſelues, in that not they, nor the profeſſours of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell were at anie time the authours thereof, but rather the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof: ſo may wee in this ſame caſe alſo doe. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue begun of your ſelues, who haue thought by force to ſtoppe the courſe of the Goſpell, or if any haue begon by others, as ſome did in <hi>Germanie</hi> by the Anabaptiſtes, our men haue beene the forwardeſt, by their writings and otherwiſe, to condemne their doings therein. And yet though it ſhould haue fallen out, or it may bee proued that in ſome one place or other there haue beene ſince this late detection of Popiſh enormities, ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly tumults, and in the ſame ſome vnlawfull force vſed, wherewith ſome indiſcreete perſons of our ſide, may iuſtly bee charged, as long as it is a thing which we neither like, allow, nor iuſtify in them, what reaſon is there, that that ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected as matter of ſufficient diſgrace to all the reſt of vs, and to our Religion alſo? Is it impoſſible for ſuch thinges, to fall out ſometimes amongſt them that profeſſe Gods trueth, euen in well ordered common weales? Then truely of al men in the world, the men of your profeſſion will bee proued to haue leaſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Gods trueth. For neuer were there more broiles, hoate contentions and force more vſed to compaſſe your wils, then haue beene amongſt you: euery ſeuerall order of Religious men, euery abbey, euery Cathedrall Church (if the ſtories were ſearched) miniſters vnto vs infinite demonſtration, that there hath nothing beene more vſuall amongſt you. O the lamentable and moſt ſauage cruell dealing that hath beene vſed with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation by men of your ſide, to bring the poore <hi>Indians</hi> by force in ſubiection vnto you. And what extreame force and crueltie hath beene vſed of late yeares, to ſubdue the poore Chriſtians of <hi>Cabriers Merindoll,</hi> and other places thereabout, and to roote out the profeſſours of the Goſpell, and their fauourers in <hi>France?</hi> I am perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> neuer vſed more faithles, tyrannical and monſtrous dealings, then the ſtories and the euidence of the thing, declares you haue vſed againſt theſe. And therefore it being ſo vſuall a thing with you, as it is, to promote your Religion by force, of all men you are the vnfitteſt to charge others with that, as with a fault, which you account ſo laudable in your ſelues. And
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18269:128"/> yet as though you had ſaied ſo much againſt vs for this, as that thereupon it muſt needs appeare to euery man, that we haue neither reaſon of our ſaying or doing, you further charge vs, that herein (in ſeeking namely the reformation of your Church) we haue taken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to all laws both diuine and humane, being alſo a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be our owne iudge; wherein you ſay vntruely of vs, for we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue beene contented, to ſubmit both our ſayings and doings, to the iudgement of the Lord himſelfe, ſpeaking vnto vs in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, and by the ſame we haue had our ſayings and doings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten examined, and tried to be ſound and lawfull in nationall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Synodes, before we haue attempted the reformation you ſpeake of. And ſecondly, herein you charge vs as you did before, with that which you your ſelues are openly guilty of. For though your Pope be the ſpeciall party accuſed by vs, yet in all matters in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt you and vs, you wil haue him to be the ſupreme iudge, and ſo the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being betwixt you &amp; vs, whither you be the church or we, and whither you hold the trueth or we, no other triall will you admit, but that we muſt be iudged by him, whither it be ſo or no. Wherein you deale, as if the felon at the bar, ſhould refuſe all other triall, but to be tried by the principall in that felony, whither he be guilty or no. Now wheras yet in this our dealing, you would reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs to him, that gaue Chriſt a blow &amp;c. Your errour is manifold, &amp; therein it ſeemeth either your negligence was much, or that your wits were benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med. For where the ſtory you allude vnto is. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. it is quoted in your booke <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. &amp; neither doe you hit of Chriſts words, in rehearſing the anſwere to him that ſmote him, nor yet is there any reaſon or ſimilitude made to appeare, betwixt our dealing in ſeeking to reform your Church, &amp; that fellow. Chriſts anſwer was this, <hi>if I haue euill ſpoken, beare witneſſe if the euill, but if I haue well ſpoken, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> And you ſet downe his anſwere thus, <hi>if we haue done il, proue it before the iudge, ſeeing that you are our accuſers:</hi> &amp; as for the reſemblance betwixt him that ſmote Chriſt and vs, you ſhew not wherein it is, neither can I geſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ment it. But indeed your dealing with vs conſidered, he cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a liuely reſemblance of a number of you, whoſe property it is, to bring vs for our holy profeſſion before your high prieſt, and his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, and then if we chance to anſwere boldly for our own defence as Chriſt did (though neuer ſo directly to the purpoſe) to checke vs, and ſtrike vs, as he did our ſauiour, for your great prelates may not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18269:128"/> ſo be anſwered. But perhaps you wil ſay, that the words that you ſet downe, containe your anſwere to vs, when we checke you for your doings: why then ſet you them downe, as the anſwere made by Chriſt to him that ſmote him? And if the words be taken as your anſwere to vs (meaning therein ſuch a iudge, as either the Pope or one of his ſworne men) that we ſhould be drawen before ſuch iudges by your owne law here alleaged, is againſt reaſon, for they can be no competent iudges, becauſe they themſelues are principall parties. Our accuſation of you we are alwaies ready to proue, before the Lord of heauen and earth, and before any other indifferent iudges, by ſuch deponents and witneſſes, as will not bee corrupted either by you or vs, namely by the prophets and Apoſtles ſpeaking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all partiality, in the Canonical ſcriptures. Exemption from this iudgement we neuer ſought nor will, and if your religion flye this kinde of triall and iudgement, God hath giuen vs power euen thereby to iudge, that you are ſuch as ought to be driuen from poſſeſſion of ſuch a corrupt religion, that dare not ſhew the face in this court of iudgment, becauſe then it knoweth, it ſhould bee foyled. But yet to holde your Clyents in ſome lyking of your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you once againe confidently bragge, that it is of one thouſand fiue hundred yeares continuance and vpwards, and therefore you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vs that would diſſwade you therefrom, to ſhew our commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſealed and confirmed, as ſo great a matter doeth require, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> his was, by miracles: which in this caſe to be as neceſſary for vs, as it was for him, you ſtriue to proue in the reſt of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that otherwiſe you are not to beleeue vs. Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all this you require at our handes, and thinke you may doe it ſtil only vpon this ſuppoſition, that your religion is thus ancient, as you bragge. Firſt, let vs conſider of that point, and then proceede to the reſt which you infer thereupon. Herein, that which I haue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten already both in the later ende of the preface and in my anſwere to your 4 Chapter, doeth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly diſcouer the ſhameles follie and vanity of this your brag: howbeit becauſe I perceiue what you lacke in trueth in this matter, your purpoſe is to make vp with the ſetting a ſtout countenance vpon it: once againe, I will take the paines to ſtrip your Church and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this viſard of antiquity, which done for al your lewd brags, I doubt not, but that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal be found a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gling &amp; a new vpſtart in compariſon of that, which you pretend. Firſt therfore, to begin withal, in that the greeke
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18269:129"/> Churches (which quite brake of communion with you, in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9, in the yeare 1230, which is now not aboue 360. yeares ago) haue not yet allowed the maſſe, to be a propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the quicke and dead, do miniſter no priuate maſſes either in the Church or elſe where, reſerue not after the miniſtration of this ſacrament any part thereof, nor deny the miniſtring thereof vnder both kindes to any communicant: in that alſo they neuer yet coulde be brought, to allow of the ſupremacy of your Pope, nor of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of tranſubſtantiation, extreame vnction, purgatory &amp; of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding their miniſters the vſe of lawful mariage (in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> points now a great part of your religion conſiſts) euen thereby it may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that none of theſe points, as they are now taught by you, were re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued for catholicke 360. years ago. For if when they brake of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from you, theſe had then beene ſo accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and taken, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they had then bene acquainted with theſe, and ſo by al likelihood, had held them, as they doe other things which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, vnto this day. I am not ignorant that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenthes tyme, in a councell at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and after that agayne, in the <hi>Florentine</hi> councell, labour was made to bring them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; vnion with you againe, and that in the firſt, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Paleologus</hi> (ſo the better to compaſſe helpe to keepe his kingdome, which with brutiſh murder he had got) and ſome other of his frends, aſſented vnto a decree to that end; and that in the other likewiſe, <hi>Iohannes Paleologus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople,</hi> and the patriarch there, with ſome other greeke biſhops, amongſt whom was <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> aſſented, in ſome ſort to your Popes title and your doctrin of purgatory. But withal, good reader, I muſt tel thee, that I finde, the conſenting of the firſt, was ſo miſliked of the reſt of the biſhops of <hi>Grecia,</hi> when they came home, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtories report, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen therefore they held them, that ſo aſſented, alwaies after, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cut of from the communion of their Church, and when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, denyed them the honour of buriall. And that likewiſe the ſame ſtories report, not onely that in the later by no meanes they coulde be brought to allow of tranſubſtantiation, though there they were vrged much thereunto, but that for their yeelding in the other they were ſo reſiſted, when they came at home by one <hi>Marcus</hi> the biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and other biſhops, that they were brought to recant and to declare merely voide al that they had done there: yea moreouer it is recorded in an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t regiſter, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of <hi>Herford,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in 29. arti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18269:129"/> there alſo ſet down, the greek Church differeth quite from your Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church. And therfore hereby it ſhould ſeeme, that theſe points of popery which it hath not yet receiued, were either not at all, or at leaſt not vniuerſally receaued, before the foreſaied breach, and that therfore theſe haue not 400 years continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on their backs, which comes far ſhort of your account of 1500. years. Further euident and apparent proofes there are to make it vtterly without all queſtion, that both theſe &amp; many other points of the Roman religion, that now is, are far you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then your reckoning. For before the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> in the yeare 1414. we finde not the miniſtering the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in both kinds publickly forbid to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And in the councel of <hi>Baſil</hi> it was permitted againe in the year 1431. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> to receiue vnder both kinds, &amp; ſo there, from that day to this, many haue vſed to doe. Certaine it is (as it appeares in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>) that in his time, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was 260. years after chriſt, it was by him accounted abſurd to deny the cup to any communicant, &amp; <hi>de conſecratione diſt.</hi> 2. it is recorded, that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> who was a biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> about the yeare 500, made a flat decree to binde al men to receiue in both kinds, ſaying <hi>Either let him, that receiueth receiue both or neither, becauſe the diuiſion of one miſtery cannot bee without ſacrilege,</hi> and yet now your Popes &amp; their councels, which you hold cannot erre, conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne it for a curſed hereſie, to holde it to be needful, that this ſacrament ſhould be receiued of al communicants in both kinds. And it appeares in the ſame diſtinction, <hi>Cap. peracta;</hi> That Pope <hi>Calixt</hi> (in the yeare 223) made a flat lawe contrary to your receiued vſe now, of your prieſts receuing al alone. For there he decrees <hi>that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being done, al that wil not be ſhut fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate; for ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the apoſtles taught &amp; the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church was.</hi> How is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that your Roman Church that now is, contrary to this ancient decree, thus grounded both vpon the authority of the Apoſtles, &amp; the practiſe then of that church, in this point now practiſeth the quite contrary?

Your owne ſchoole-men, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts and Croniclers, as <hi>Durand, Albertus, Gabriel Biel, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius, Vrſpergenſis</hi> and others, ſhew from point to point and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peece to peece, who inuented &amp; deuiſed your maſſe, withall the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies thereof, as alſo <hi>Polidor</hi> in his 5. booke and 9. Chapter of the inuentours of things, and <hi>Platina</hi> in the liues of the Popes, and namely, in the life of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the firſt. It was ſo long a lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before it came to the ſhape it now hath, and was patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it appeares in theſe and other your owne writers, by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Popes ſo long diſtant one from an other in time, that it would require a good pretty long treatiſe, to ſet downe the ſeuerall ſhreds and morſelles thereof, with the authours and deuiſers of them. Which things conſidered, it is the likeſt a beggers cloake, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of an infinite ſort of patches, at ſundry times and of ſundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſowed and cobled together, that can be. The maſſe now v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in your church, commonly called S. <hi>Gregories</hi> maſſe was firſt receaued and eſtabliſhed in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> 780. years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt (at the leaſt, for others accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it more) as witneſſeth <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, Nauclere, &amp; Iacobus de voragine</hi> in the life of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt, for before that, S. <hi>Ambroſe Lyturgie</hi> was much in vſe. And the laſt of theſe authours reports, that when with much a do, <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> had got it to bee decreede in a councell, that S. <hi>Gregories</hi> maſſe ſhould be vniuerſally vſed, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour had laboured both by faire and foule meanes, to cauſe the ſame decree to bee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and yet many would hardly be drawen from the vſe of Saint <hi>Ambroſes,</hi> one <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſeing this ſtir about it, gaue the Pope this graue aduiſe, that the bookes of both the <hi>Lyturgies</hi> ſhould be layed vpon the altar of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that the Church dores ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ſhut and ſealed with the ſignets of ſundry Biſhops, and that then they ſhould giue themſelues all that night to earneſt prayer, that God by ſome euident ſigne, might ſhew which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue to be vſed: whoſe counſell being in euery point followed, in the next morning, when they went into the church, they found (as ſaieth the ſtory) onely S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> booke opened and lying vpon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and the leaues of the other ſcattered all ouer the church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Adrian</hi> the Pope, like a profound interpreter of viſions, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that it was the Lords meaning thereby to ſhew, that S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſes Lyturgy</hi> might well be vſed vpon his owne altar at <hi>Millan,</hi> but the other ſhould be vſed generally ouer all churches, and thus
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18269:130"/> the credit of <hi>Saint Gregories</hi> maſſe was firſt eſtabliſhed. Howbeit before tranſubſtantiation came in, which was not, as I haue ſayed, before the yeare 1215, it was nothing the minion that it hath beene ſince. And yet euen then, it was not growen to her higheſt credit, for about fiue yeares after it was, ere that adoration or eleuation of the hoſt was decreed, for then firſt <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3 enacted that; and the hoſts holiday, commonly called <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, was not made before Pope <hi>Vrbans</hi> tyme, in the year 1260. as witneſſeth <hi>Polydor</hi> in his 6 booke and 8 Chapter of the inuentours of things. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeare, that the maſſe as it is now, is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry youngling, and one of her father the Popes youngeſt daughters. And as for latin ſeruice her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion, it was firſt brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by one <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſent hither by Pope <hi>Vitellian,</hi> about the yeare 657.

Your doctrine of auricular confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of praying to Saints, &amp; for the dead, I haue at large in my anſwere to your thirty ſeuen Chapter, ſhewed to be but new doctrines, and of far later ſtampe then you pretend, and in like maner elſewhere I haue ſhewed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other points of your religion to be, in this aunſwere of mine. And I thinke you are not ignoraunt, that that worthy biſhop, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Iewel,</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> hath moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted, that for 600. years after Chriſt, you haue no ſound grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for 25. articles (whereof the moſt of them, are about your maſſe, whereof you glory moſt) which proteſtation or chalenge of his, he hath hitherto defended, ſufficiently againſt all your obiections to the contrary. And therefore whatſoeuer you bragge to the contrary, ſo much of your religion, as we count it popiſh for, is and will proue (when you haue done what you can) but as the tares <hi>Math.</hi> 13 that were by Sathan ſubtly and ſecretly ſowen in the Lords field, long after the good ſeed was ſowen. And yet we labouring onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our callinges, and that knowledge that God hath giuen vs of his trueth out of his written word, to call you from this newe found pretended religion of yours, to the ancient and true catholicke faith, which we haue learned out of the ſcriptures, and of alſound antiquity: you not onely burſt out into this vaine and monſtrouſly falſe brags, of the antiquity of yours, and nouelty of ours, but alſo knowing in your own conſciences, that your folly therein wil ſoone be deſcried, you cal then for miracles to confirme and warrant this our commiſſion by, which you would faine proue, to be as neceſſarie for vs in this caſe, as it was for <hi>Moſes</hi> in his time, thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his. Wherunto I ſay as vpon the like occaſion, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid in his time, <hi>de ciuitate Dei l.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Whoſoeuer yet ſeeketh after miracles, that ſo he may beleeue, he himſelfe is a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous miracle, who the world beleeuing, yet beleeues not.</hi> For if our doctrine be the ſame, that the Apoſtles taught (as we are alwaies ready, and by GODS grace able to proue it to be, by the vndoubted woord of God) then their miracles are ſo many ſeales of this our doctrine, and ſo it beeing thereby ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed already by miracles, needles is it to require any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18269:135"/> thereof now, by new miracles againe. But you ſeeme to take it for granted, that we ſtand either very much, or altogither vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the extraordinarines of our vocation, and therfore ſuppoſing that ſuch a vocation muſt alwaies be confirmed by miracles, you call for them the rather, thus earneſtly at our hands. Concerning which point, I haue tolde you already, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though in ſuch ruins of the church, as you had brought it vnto, it bee no ſtrange thing with God to ſtir vp men extraordinarily, to ſeeke the reformation thereof, as he did many of the Prophets: yet neither the firſt miniſters, which in theſe later daies, he hath vſed to this end amongſt vs, nor thoſe that he hath vſed ſince, to go on with that which the others began, rely onely vpon an extraordinary calling, for as I haue ſhewed, both the one and the other, haue had outward ordinary calling. Beſides you muſt vnderſtand, that a man may haue an extraordinary calling, as had <hi>Nahu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Abdia,</hi> &amp; diuers other of the prophets, who yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew, euer wrought any miracles to confirme their calling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. And to vſe <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> words, which he vſed againſt ſuch as you, in that commentary vpon <hi>Matth. Hom.</hi> 47. which you father vpon him, what miracle wrought <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> which inſtructed ſo many and great Cities? For the Euangeliſt ſaieth he wrought none <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. And yet who therefore may lawfully ſay, that he had no lawfull vocation or good commiſſion. Againe you know by that which is writen <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and elſwhere: that falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yea Antichriſt himſelfe, may and ſhal ſeeke to ſeduce men, and to draw men from God by miracles, &amp; therefore there God forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his people thereof, that if notwithſtanding they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the rather to be peruerted thereby, they may be voide of al ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Wherefore, ſeeing there haue bene ſundry true prophets extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily called, that yet haue wrought no miracles, and alſo many falſe prophets, that haue wrought them, and may doe agayne; to what purpoſe ſhould you thus call for miracles, as though they ſtraight might lawfully be refuſed, that worke them not, and they ſafely alwayes followed, that doe them? Howſoeuer you ſeeme to pretend, that if we ſhould worke miracles you would beleeue vs, yet certayne it is, that if we ſhould worke neuer ſo many, you would as little for all that beleeue vs, as the blinde and ſuperſtitious Iewes beleeued Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for all the myracles wrought by them: but this is onely a ſhift of yours, as long as you may, to dazell the eyes of the ſimple. For queſtionles if myracles would ſerue the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18269:136"/> turne, beſide ſundry miracles indeede which the ſtories doe teſtifie, haue beene wrought by God, in the protection and propagation of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we now profeſſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is a miracle of miracles, that <hi>Luther,</hi> lyuing in ſuch a time as he did, ſhould doe as he did, &amp; to ſo great effect w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out miracle, &amp; yet in the end, maugre al his enemies, which were many &amp; mighty, to die quietly, as he did, in his bed. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al theſe things conſidered, it appeareth (I hope) ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader, that you haue no ſuch aduantage againſt vs for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and you pretend. But becauſe your obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this behalfe is ſo egerly proſecuted by you, I wil not refuſe to follow you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtep to ſtep &amp; to yeeld you a more particuler a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer, to whatſoeuer you haue ſayed in this matter. Firſt therefore, whereas you would inſinuate to your reader, that we doe wrong, in comparing the miſery that the poor people were in, vnder your Popes, to the miſery that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in, in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> vnder <hi>Pharao;</hi> &amp; their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romiſh yoke, to the deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that people, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you, we make that compariſon ſometimes, &amp; we are ſure, that therein there is offred no wrong at al vnto you. For both in vniuerſality, continuannce of time, and extremity both to ſoule &amp; bodie, the ſlauery vnder your proud antichriſtian Popes, hath excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theirs, vnder <hi>Pharao</hi> in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and conſequently, the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the people from that of yours, muſt needes (beeing as it is both more ſpiritual and general, then that of theirs was) much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of theirs. But that therefore, it is as neceſſary that wee ſhould anew work miracles, to confirme our vocation, to doe this; as it was for <hi>Moſes</hi> to confirme his calling, to doe the other thereby: therin you are both deceiued &amp; ſeeke alſo to deceiue others. For <hi>Moſes</hi> by God was ſhewed, that he ſhould ſo confirme his, and ſo are not we that we ſhal or ought ſo to confirme ours, and his calling thereunto was not onely extraordinary, whereas ours in great part at leaſt (as I haue ſhewed) hath bene to this ordinary, but alſo the thing it ſelfe and the means to bring it to paſſe, both in the eies of <hi>Pharao</hi> &amp; al others, were ſtrange &amp; miraculous, wheras in this our caſe in delyuering me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruitude, &amp; bringing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the liberty &amp; freedome purchaſed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the bloud of Chriſt, by the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God ſincerely, &amp; miniſtring his ſacraments accordingly, both are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; ordinary. For what is more ordinary w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, then to bring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error to trueth, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by theſe means in his church? The thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to doe was a new &amp; ſtrange thing: for a man of his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18269:136"/> quality w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out force of war &amp; weapons to deliuer ſo great &amp; gainful a people out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of ſuch an hard hearted tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful, &amp; therfore it was likewiſe neceſſary, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means that he ſhould effect that by, eſpecially ſhould be miracles. Finally there was no certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner way for <hi>Moſes,</hi> hauing to deal w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch an one as he had, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his calling by miracles, wheras ours in this, is far more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiallie iuſtified by the ſcriptures, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce our doctrine hath war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath wrought this effect, then it could haue by miracles. For as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law was firſt publiſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ceremonies therof, it was needful, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was new, that <hi>Moſes</hi> credit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publiſher ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law it ſelfe, ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by miracle, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raigne of <hi>Ioſiah, Hilkiah</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of the law, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> had lien hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a long time, &amp; ſo did but reuiue or renue the ſame law, that was before ſufficiently confirmed by miracles, he wrought no miracles, neither was there any called for, or looked for at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for it was needles. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ceaſing of the ceremonial ſeruice of the law was to end, &amp; the new prieſthood of Chriſt to come in place thereof, &amp; ſo withal that then firſt it ſhould be notified both to Iew and gentile who was and is the very perſon of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> &amp; what new gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; ſacraments he would haue in his houſe, it was neceſſary that miracles ſhould be wrought, to confirme the miniſtry of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould teach theſe new &amp; ſtrange thinges firſt vnto the world: but now theſe things hauing bene already then ſufficiently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by miracles, we comming in theſe later daies of the world, and not taking vpon vs, to preach any other doctrine then the former, and ſo onely renuing and reuiuing the knowledge of that, which by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce and wickednes of former times, had lyen in great part hid, no more at our hands ought miracles to be looked for. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede if it could be proued but once, that we labour to ſet abroach a new doctrine (as you often in wordes charge vs) that neuer was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently confirmed by miracles, or if the maner that we vſed to reuiue it by, were any other, but the ancient ordinary way that God hath alwaies allowed in his Church, there were yet ſome colour of reaſon, why they ſhould bee thus called for at our handes. But ſeeing wee ſtand vpon that point, and haue alwaies done, that our religion is the very ſame, and no other that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, which by them in their times was confirmed by miracles, and the maner of our dealing to ſpread the ſame againe, is but the ordinary miniſterie of the worde
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18269:137"/> and ſacraments, by them left for the ſame purpoſe vnto the church, there is no reaſon at all, in matching vs, thus as you doe, with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in requiring miracles of vs, as of him. And vntill you can proue by the ſcriptures, that the doctrine that we preach is falſe, which you neuer ſhall be able to doe, the three places which you cite out of <hi>Ieremie</hi> 14.27. &amp; 29. vttered by him, to admoniſh the people in his time, to take heede of ſuffering of themſelues to be ſeduced, with the falſe and lying Prophets, that were in thoſe daies, make nothing at all againſt vs, nor yet appertaine to the matter in hand: which was to proue, that ſeeing we worke no miracles, therefore our commiſſion cannot be good, in taking vpon vs to reforme you. For in theſe places (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the words as they are ſet down by your ſelfe) it moſt euidently appeares, that he warned the people to take heede onely of ſuch Prophets, as prophecied falſly in the name of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no vocation from him, and labouring to ſeduce the people by falſe viſions, naughty diuinations, ſouthſayings and their owne dreames: whereas we haue ordinary vocation from God preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trueth warranted by his word, and neuer vſe, but alwaies abhor the vſe, of all theſe meanes, that they vſed to ſeduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by. But herein moſt certaine it is, that the Lord moſt plainely forewarneth his people of ſuch as you be. For you be they indeede, that were neuer ſent of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt, and that preach falſe doctrine, as doeth appeare not only by the diſſenting, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of your doctrine, in a number of points from the vndoubted word of God (as I haue noted in ſundrie places in this my anſwere to you) and then whom neuer any falſe Prophets in the world, more relied vpon falſe viſions, diuinations, ſouthſayings &amp; fond dreames; for indeede they are the beſt &amp; moſt vſuall pillers, &amp; grounds of your Popiſh doctrine. For what is more common with you, then to the ende theſe may haue place, to complaine, and by long rhetoricall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to make what ſhew you can, of the obſcurity, vnſufficiency and vncertainty of the word writen; that ſo with ſome colour, you may ſhew the triall of your doctrine, by that touchſtone, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in your owne conſciences you know, that it cannot be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby. And then, when thus you haue ſatiſfied your ſelues in weakning, what you may, the credit of the ſcriptures, to prepare a way for your ſelues to fly from them: then you breake out into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the word vnwriten, traditions, and liuely practiſe of the church, that ſo by that window, you may thruſt in and out to the

Trueth it is, we dare not compare in faithfulnes with Chriſt, for ſuch compariſon were odious, but with S. <hi>Paul</hi> we proteſt, that in ſeruing the God of our fathers, according to that Religion which you count hereſie, beleeuing all that is writen in the law &amp; the Prophets, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies endeuoured to keepe a good conſcience both before God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Indeed if we took vpon vs, either any callings not warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the Lord in his word, or to preach any doctrine which we could not warrant by the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures, you might with ſome reaſon call for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of vs: but ſeeing you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue neither of theſe againſt vs, you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18269:140"/> may with more reaſon giue ouer this obiection, then to purſue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further. Indeede we are not aſhamed to confeſſe, that theſe are two principall reaſons, which are here reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred by you, wherby we proue our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the true &amp; ancient Catholicke faith, taught by the Apoſtles, and euer ſince continued in Chriſtes true Church: namely firſt, for that by the Canonicall ſcriptures, we can proue it to be the ſame that they preached, ſeeing it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied, but their preaching and writing agreed; and ſecondly, becauſe our Religion in all points agreeth with the ancient groundes of the Catechiſme, the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the articles of the faith, the Lords praier &amp;c. And for theſe cauſes indeede, we moſt confidently ſay and aduouch, that you doe vs extreame wrong, the trueth &amp; ſoundnes of theſe two reaſons notwithſtanding, either to call our Church or Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> new, or thus to call for miracles to confirme it now, as though it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene confirmed thereby before. But in all this, with you we ſay nothing to the purpoſe: yet with the indifferent Reader (I hope) it is to good and great purpoſe, ſeeing hereby we labour to proue, that our church and Religion is not new, and but of 40. yeares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as here moſt vntruly you charge it: but olde &amp; ancient, becauſe it agreeth in euery point with the principles of the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Catechiſme. All you ſay to confute this argument of ours, is, that we haue learned our Catechiſme of you, &amp; otherwiſe we ſhould not or could not haue come by it. Whereunto I anſwere, that if wee had had no better Catechiſers then you, we had yet beene but badly Catechiſed: and this further you may be ſure of, your credit was by your long and manifold lewd dealing ſo crackt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, if we had not found theſe parts of the Catechiſme, either flatly expreſſed or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed, and grounded in the Canonicall ſcriptures, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your credit we had not receiued them: beſides, as I haue plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhewed in the 4. Chapter, we haue had in all ages, from Chriſt downe to our owne, very manie of our owne Religion, that haue continued, and from hand to hand deliuered vnto vs, theſe partes of the Catechiſme, more ſoundly and faithfully then you haue done, ſo that, if you had neuer beene, we ſhould farre better and ſooner haue learned theſe things. But in the moſt wiſe prouidence of God, theſe were in ſome ſort alſo continued amongſt you, that ſo you might be the more without excuſe, in that, notwithſtanding the light that migh haue ſhined vnto you thereby, you yet chuſed rather to walke in groſſe and palpable darkneſſe, then in the light thereof. And therefore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18269:140"/> ſathan the Prince of darkneſſe, in your Synagogues, through the helpe of his vicar generall your Pope, and his Chaplaines, neuer ceaſed vntill by one blinde and helliſh perſwaſion or other (whatſoeuer <hi>Paul</hi> had taught to the contrarie 1 <hi>Corint.</hi> 14.) he brought to paſſe, not onely, that all your Lyturgie and ſeruice ſhould bee in Latin, and rather lying legends permitted to be read, in the Churches publickly in the mother tongue, then the Scriptures of God: but alſo that theſe portions of the Catechiſme ſhould, either not bee learned at all, or elſe onely in the Latin and vnknowen tongue, which he knew was all one in effect.

At laſt (ſo earneſt a procter, or crier are you for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are contented to ioine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs vpon this point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though our doctrine were not new, but very old, yet we muſt &amp; ought to confirme it by miracles, And this you labour to proue, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine that <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Apoſtles were ſent to preach, was not new, but old, &amp; yet they were furniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> power to worke miracles, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme that old &amp; ancient doctrine. For <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought his miracles (you ſay) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to this ende, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods name might be knowen ouer all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, that is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men ſhould know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is God: &amp; the Apoſtles (as you ſay) at their firſt preaching, preached not Ieſus Chriſt vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils, but that there was but one God: which by a number of teſtimonies you labour to proue was no new doctrin to the heathen &amp; Painims; but a thing, which by the light of nature left in them, and by the view of Gods works, many of them atteined vnto, &amp; all might in ſuch ſort, as that they are without excuſe, for that they worſhipped not God, as God. This is (I confeſſe) directly to the matter, and ſome ſhew theſe things cary (I graunt) of proofe of that, which you toke in hande thereby to proue. But if we examine well thoſe things, and weigh the weight of this argument, wee ſhall finde ſmall, or rather no force at all therein, to proue indeede the thing intended thereby. For though God ſaie <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. not 19. (as your quotation is) that for this cauſe hee had ſet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> vp, to ſhew his power in him, and to declare his name throughout the whole world (as in working of all miracles at all times, that is an eſpeciall ende that the Lord hath.) And though that bee no newe doctrine, that hee is God, and but one, and that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Apoſtles taught this: yet this proueth not, but that otherwiſe both <hi>Moſes</hi> and they had newe and ſtrange matters giuen them in commiſſion, for confirmation and effecting whereof, it was neceſſarie for them to worke miracles. For <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> eſpecially was called, and appointed by God (as it appeareth <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.4. and 5. Chapters) to this ende, to ſignifie vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that it was the pleaſure of God, that he ſhould diſmiſſe his people. Which becauſe the Lord had purpoſed (notwithſtanding the harde heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) to bring to paſſe, therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> was by his direction to worke the miracles, hee wrought. So that the next ende of working of them, was to confirme this his newe and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18269:142"/> ſtrange meſſage to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to cauſe it to take place, though therein the Lord had another further ende, namely thereby to get himſelfe a name for euer. So in like maner, though the Apoſtles preached the God that made heauen &amp; earth, to be the only true God (as it appeareth they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.) which was no new doctrine indeede in it ſelfe conſidered, yet it appeareth in the ſame places, that it was newe there. For in the one place, they worſhipped <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> for Gods; and in the other, an vnknowen God. And beſides it is euident, that not onely their office was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, in that immediately they had their calling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and their charge without limitation: but alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compaſſe of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they had to doe many new and ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge things; namely, to call the Gentils to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fellowſhip of the Church, to preach the abrogation of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies, to adminiſter new ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to ordeine new officers in the Church, as Euangeliſts, paſtours, and doctours, and eſpecially, to preach Ieſus Chriſt to be the perſon of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> god and man, the onely and ſole Sauiour of the world: for which things ſake, it was needfull for them to worke miracles, howſoeuer it was needeles in reſpect of the other old doctrine concerning the one true God. And therefore to make it appeare, that their miracles were wrought eſpecially for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confirmation of this point, that Ieſus was the Chriſt, &amp; the perſon of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> alwaies they worke their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in his name, whereas wee doe not preach ſome one point of olde doctrine onely, but altogether from point to point our doctrine is olde, and hath beene ſufficiently by Chriſt and his Apoſtles alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy confirmed by miracles: neither haue we any newe, but the olde ordinary offices of paſtours and doctours to publiſh it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, wee take vpon vs no newe or ſtrange thing, but labour as nigh, as poſſibly we can, to conforme our ſelues euerie waie to the patterne ſhewed vs of ancient time, by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Wherefore, vnleſſe as you haue ſhewed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Apoſtles taught this one olde leſſon, that there is but one God, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made heauen &amp; earth: ſo ye could haue ſhewed alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wrought al their miracles to confirme that, &amp; that otherwiſe beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had no new &amp; ſtrange things to doe &amp; teach, for confirmation whereof, miracles were needeful, &amp; therefore done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſay of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing to binde vs to worke miracles, doing nothing, or teaching nothing otherwiſe then was done and taught 1500. yeares ago and more, by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and ſo you might

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18269:144"/> (for all theſe thinges) to confirme that by miracle: whereas now amongſt vs, that beare any waie the name of Chriſtians, that doctrine is not newe, neither anie thing elſe that wee preach, but to thoſe to whom the ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught in the Scriptures is newe, and therefore as yet there remaineth cauſe ſufficient, why the Apoſtles ſhould worke miracles, and not wee. This alſo I cannot but tell you of, that howſoeuer the <hi>Sybilles</hi> are reported to haue prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of Chriſt, your compariſon is verie odious, when you ſaie, <hi>they did it as fully, and as plainelie as anie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> and that you wrong <hi>Auguſtine</hi> too too much, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Reader beleeue, that hee either in the place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you, or anie where elſe ioyneth with you in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laperte compariſon.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> haue ſhewed you my reaſon in the former Chapter, why you muſt ſtay (for all your premiſes) from the concluſion, that you beginne withall in this. For howſoeuer ſome few of them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heard in ſome ſort, that ſuch a <hi>Meſsias</hi> either ſhould come or was come, yet the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticuler perſon, who that ſame was, was firſt preached by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> &amp; ſecondly by <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wyfe (<hi>Luke.</hi> 1.) before he was borne: then by the Angels to the ſhepheards the day of his birth, after by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna, Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and the reſt, as it followeth ſet downe in the ſtory: <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you ſay yet further, that though their doctrine concerning Ieſus Chriſt the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was vnknowen to the Gentiles, yet it was not ſo to the Iewes, for the Apoſtles preached nothing, but that which had warrant from the law and the prophets, as you proue (I graunt) wel out of the 1. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> and 10. of the <hi>Acts:</hi> conferring thoſe places with the 53. of <hi>Eſay</hi> (though wrong quoted by you) and out of the prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi> I graunt, they preached nothing, that ought to haue beene new vnto them, foraſmuch as euery thing that they preached, had ground in the olde Teſtament, but yet (as you after ſeeme to confeſſe) it was growen new not onely to the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but alſo to the Iewes, in that they were miſſe-led in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the prophecies, that went before of him, both concerning his perſon and office, through their ignorance, corrupt gloſſes, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, that by falſe teachers were made thereof. Inſomuch, that when the <hi>Meſsias</hi> came and executed his office (though indeed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18269:145"/> all the ancient prophecies were yea &amp; Amen in him, and moſt plainly in reſpect of euery circumſtance verified) yet they could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, either that he was ſuch a one in perſon, or office, as he was, and therefore then once it was neceſſary by all other good meanes &amp; miracles alſo, to confirme the doctrine concerning him, which was thorowly done by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their tymes. Now whereas hereupon you would inferre, <hi>that ſeeing wee match you with the ſuperſtitious Iewes, and Idolatrous Painims, and our ſelues take vpon vs Succeſsion to the Apoſtles, and to the true catholique and Apoſtolique Church, and to reforme you of your errours, as they did theirs; therefore we preaching that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctrine of God, and of his Chriſt, that they did: we now alſo ſhould confirme our doctrine &amp; commiſsion by miracles, as they did.</hi> Beſide many other, there are two principal things, that let you from this concluſion. The firſt is, that howſoeuer other things were old, y they taught of God, &amp; the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> yet this was new, who was the very perſon of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> Wherin if they had erred (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they had rightly vnderſtood the generall doctrine both of his perſon, and office) it had bene moſt dangerous for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that doctrine eſpecially is vrged by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as for example you may ſee in <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon to <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. And for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that doctrin, they work al their miracles, not generally in the name of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but particulerly in the name of Ieſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as it appeareth <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which thing in reſpect of you, we haue not, for that is a thing agreed on betwixt vs. Another ſtop to your concluſion is, ſeing that doctrine hath bene once ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirmed by miracles, by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we teach, and you haue the ſame doctrine and miracles ſet downe in the new Teſtament, whereunto you ſeeme to giue credit, as wel as we: it is thenceforth needles for the miniſters thereof, howſoeuer they meete w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people, that for Idolatry &amp; ſuperſtitious errours match the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, &amp; the Iewes in the Apoſtles times: to vſe any other proofe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from thoſe records of the ſcripture, which ought now to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſufficient, &amp; therefore now the calling for miracles to be out of time. To reaſon therfore as you doe, It was neceſſary for the Apoſtles in their time to worke miracles: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is neceſſary alſo now for vs, though our doctrine be the ſame; is beſides and without reaſon. And yet for al this, we recant no whit for comparing you to the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Iewes, and Idolatrous heathen. For if either be worſe then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18269:146"/> we thinke it is like to proue your ſelues, in that hauing far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes, and more knowledge of God, and his Chriſt, then they had, yet you multiply your Idolatries and ſuperſtitious conceites far beyond them. And euen for this, that notwithſtanding your better meanes to keepe you in the waies of God, and your more knowledge, then they had, when Chriſt and his Apoſtles came firſt vnto them to preach this Goſpel; you match them in groſſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and in multitude of ſuperſtitions, and falſe opinions; is it, that God, vouchſafing the better to conuert them, to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles then; thinketh it fit to anſwere you now, as the rich glutton was enforced in the like caſe; <hi>ye haue Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> yea &amp; alſo the books of the New Teſtament; <hi>and if you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, you would not beleeue, though one ſhould riſe from death againe;</hi> or what miracle ſoeuer els were wrought. But wher as you ſuppoſe, that the cauſe why the Apoſtles wrought miracles, was the blinde Idolatry of the heathen, &amp; ſuperſtitions of the Iews onely; and not any newnes of any part of their doctrine; you are much deceiued, as you may perceiue by that which I haue ſaied. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if you would perſwade, that their doctrine was in no point new, becauſe in the doctrine of one God, and in the doctrine of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> in ſome points it was not, or ought not to haue bene ſo, your logicke is flender. For in other points it might be new, as I haue tolde you, and ſo in reſpect thereof, though not of the other, miracles were neceſſary. But this your obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of lacke of miracles, pleaſeth you ſo well, that you cannot haue done with it; let vs therfore heare, what further you can ſay, touching this matter.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18269:146"/> is to wit, <hi>Andrew Coralſtadius,</hi> and from thence was produced another called <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and of <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius.</hi> Then, <hi>Thomas Muncerus,</hi> conſidering, that he had no leſſe the gift of the spirit then the reſt, hee beganne to forge a newe Gospell of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> vvith the which hee thought to gratifie the Towne of <hi>Milhouſe,</hi> vvho had receaued alreadie the Goſpel of <hi>Luther.</hi> But the Senate of that towne, beeing vvearied already with two manie ſtraunge Gospels, they aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed <hi>Luther</hi> you firſt Apoſtle of it.

                  <p>Theſe are the words of <hi>Luther.</hi> We ought to yeelde that that is right to euerie bodie, &amp; not depriue anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the praiſe that he doth deſerue.

In trueth the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your doctrine conſidered, in compariſon of that taught in the word, and the ſtrangeneſſe of the order of your Church, from that of Chriſtes, in the primatiue time thereof; leade vs rather more iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to followe this counſell of <hi>Luther</hi> againſt you, then any thing in vs can truely moue you to vrge it, againſt vs. Which if we ſhould doe, certainely either ſhould we finde you as voide of miracles, as

For now that the ſunne of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhineth abroad, we heare little noiſe of your apparitions and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other ſuch antichriſtian miracles, that there was ſo great talke of before.

Wherfore, make as much of this counſell of <hi>Luther,</hi> as you wil, it wil proue in the end to touch you more, then vs. You cite alſo a ſaying of <hi>Caluin</hi> in his 3.

For who of vs euer either in word or deed contraried that ſpeach or doctrine of his? that is the thing that we obiect againſt you, that of your own heads ye haue deuiſed a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>ANother Miniſter likewiſe called <hi>Apollinaris</hi> followed after theſe, ſent by the ſaied maſter, &amp; yet according to his ſaying, he did preach the pure word of God, affirming that the Church ought to bee reformed, which had beleeued, that the two natures were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that the true religion was, to beleeue, as it is writen in the <hi>1</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the word was indeed become fleſh, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into fleſh: And to confirme this, he did alleage the ſaied place, where <hi>S.

Of this opinion was <hi>Apollinaris, Theodorus, Moſſneſtenus:</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> came after, and they did blame the Catholick Church, becauſe it did teach the ſaied vnion, called, as I haue ſaied, <hi>Hipoſtatique,</hi> that is to ſaie, of the two natures in one perſon. And they did alleage for their argument a verie ſubtil reaſon, the which was, that God did inhabite within the body of our ſauiour, as he did within a Temple, that is to ſay, by grace, and not by being vnited togither. And therefore, euen as it were a great folly, to ſaie that God is a Temple, that ſo it is to ſaie, that God is a man.

                  <p>NEither our owne Doctors, nor any thing els that yet you haue ſaied (for all your great brag) haue any force either to diſproue that lawfulnes of our vocation, or to condemne our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither is it true, that we ſtand ſo much vpon our extraordinary calling, as you would inſinuate to your reader. For we tel you, that if you take ordinary calling in your owne ſence, if ther be any good at al, in that <hi>Wickliffe, Iohn Hus, Luther, Bucer,</hi> and the reſt that haue bene the firſt &amp; formoſt in theſe late daies in detecting the errours of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and in renuing the light of the goſpel, had that kinde of calling. And as for the reſt ſince, they haue had a better ordinary calling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, in that it hath bene more agreeing to the order of calling by the Apoſtles and primatiue Church. But in that, to expreſſe what you meane by our extraordinary calling (you ſay) that therby you meane a calling without commiſſion of the paſtours and biſhops &amp;c. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that therefore it is, that you charge many of our miniſters to preach the goſpel extraordinarily, becauſe (howſoeuer otherwiſe they had, before they tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them any dealing in the miniſtry, the ordinary calling allowed of in the reformed Churches of Chriſt, where they were to exerciſe the ſame) they tooke not firſt any of your popiſh orders, at the hands of ſome of your popiſh lord biſhops, after your popiſh maner. In which ſort I graunt you, many of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue an extraordinary calling: but then I ſay vnto you againe, that their extraordinary calling (hauing an eie to that order that Chriſt and his Apoſtles left in this caſe vnto the Church) is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, then the ordinary calling that you ſpeake of. And therefore though their calling of late daies here amongſt vs, hath not bene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your order, &amp; that they haue neither beene choſen by your paſtours, nor had impoſition of hands of your Lord biſhops, yet you cannot ſay truely, that any of them take vpon them extraordinarily, that is, as you expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, without the commiſſion of the paſtours and biſhops to preach the Goſpel. Name the man, time, and place, you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not when and where, any that is accounted amongſt vs a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the goſpell, hath either ſayed, that thus hee ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued to preach the goſpell, or hath attempted ſo to doe. For it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18269:153"/> is generally held and receiued of al the Churches, that profeſſe the goſpell, and ſo lykewiſe is their vniforme practiſe, that none be ſuffered to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to preach the goſpel, vnleſſe it be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and ſufficiently appeare, that by the ordinary calling of ſome according to the order of the Church, where hee is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he be ſufficiently authoriſhed ſo to doe. And wel knowen it is, that there is no Church that profeſſes the Goſpel indeed, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof is, that none meddle in the miniſtry therein, without commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it pleaſeth you to ſpeake) either from ſome conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t number of paſtours, or from ſome biſhop, or from both, by the order of that church appointed to looke to, and to take care of that buſines. As for the Anabaptiſts, a captaine whereof you named in the former Chapter, we know, that in their fantaſtical ſpirit, they both hold and practiſe, as here you charge vs, but therin and therfore we diſlike &amp; condemne them as much as you. And you know we renounce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, we cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them heretickes, &amp; therfore ſundry of vs purpoſely haue writ large and vehement bookes againſt them: you doe vs therfore great wrong to charge vs with that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is their fault, &amp; which you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proue to be ours. But you wil ſay, I am ſure (for in your former Chap. you ſeeme to deriue <hi>Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer</hi> the Anabaptiſt his petigree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Luther</hi>) that we may worthely ſo be charged, for they are ſuch as ſpring of and from vs. But herein againe you offer vs as great wrong, as the ſeruants of the good ſeeds man that ſowed only good ſeed in his field, ſhould haue done him, if they had ſaied, that the tares that came vp therewith in the ſame field, had beene there ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him: becauſe when Chriſt his Apoſtles and faithfull miniſters had firſt preached the goſpel, there were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the ſame age, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp with the ſame, &amp; amongſt the profeſſours therof, <hi>Ebionites, Cerinthians, Nicolaitans, Simoniſts,</hi> and ſundry other fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heretickes, as <hi>Hymeneus, Philetus, Hermogines</hi> and <hi>Phygetus:</hi> was it any reaſon therefore that Chriſt or any of his faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or that the goſpel it ſelfe ſhould be charged with their fond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits? And yet as abſurd &amp; ſenceleſſe as this kinde of dealing were, it is both here with you oft in this your booke, &amp; vſuall is it with all of your ſpirit, this now for want of better matter againſt vs, by this means with the ſimple people to labour the diſcredit and diſgrace both of vs, our churches, and religion.</p>
                  <p>But you content not your ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> falſely charging vs to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought to be receiued to preach the goſpel extraordinarily, but alſo
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18269:154"/> you lay to our charge, that we ſeeke ſtill to defend an ill cauſe, and an extraordinary commiſſion. This you onely ſay, as your maner is, but neither proofe nor ſhadow of proofe you bring, neither indeede can you. For our cauſe is the very trueth, and our commiſſion is but that ordinary commiſſion of teaching, and confirming the ſame vnto men, that Chriſt hath left by his owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſters vnto the worlds ende. And for proofe hereof we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale indeede to the holy ſcriptures, which in this caſe euen for the reaſon by you alleadged, wee are not aſhamed to confeſſe to be the ſound touchſtone of trueth, and to be preferred in credit before mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Yet you ſome thing amplifie and adde vnto our ſpeech, in that you ſay we affirme, that the ſcriptures as they are alleadged by vs alone, ought to bee of more credit then all the miracles wrought by the Apoſtles. Well, this our reaſon, to iuſtifie our cauſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, you ſay is a notable way to deceaue the ſimple and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I wonder that you were not aſhamed and affraied ſo to write. For you cannot be ignorant, that to confute errour, to proue trueth, to exhort to vertue, and to dehort from vice, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo from time to time, the ancient fathers, what aduerſaries ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they had to deale withal, vſed alwaies to flie to this touchſtone, and for the moſt certaine concluding of their purpoſe, did alleadge ſcripture: but your ſhift will be, that theſe alleadged the ſcripture rightly, which you ſpeake not of, and we alleadge the ſcripture cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly and in a wrong ſenſe, &amp; therefore you would haue your words in all this your diſcourſe againſt our alleadging of ſcripture, to bee taken as writen not ſimply againſt alleadging of ſcripture, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt alleadging it as we doe. Then I anſwer, that that you ſhould haue proued, that we alleadge the ſcripture in a wrong ſenſe, but this you haue not once gone about: only you proue that bare allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſcripture cannot, nor may not ſo countenance our cauſe as we prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for that ſundry heretickes haue countenanced their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by alleadging ſcripture, and that often very plentifully. About this you ſpend ſundry Chapters, and withall to ſhew your ſelfe to be able, if you liſt, to be a cunning in wreſting of the ſcriptures as any of the heretickes you mention: all which is to no purpoſe, vnles withall you had proued (which you ſhall neuer be able to doe) that we alleadging them, doe alleadge them ſo likewiſe. For we are not ſo ſimple or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we know not, that the ſcripture hath beene and may be miſalleadged, as you write, and therefore we neuer go
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18269:154"/> about to perſwade the people, that they muſt and ought to beleeue vs for our bare alleadging of ſcripture: but for that by the ſound rules of interpreting of them, we proue forcibly and inuincibly vnto their conſciences, that we alleadge them according to their true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue meaning. We call vpon them with Chriſt to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 39. and with <hi>Paul</hi> we exhort them ſo to trauaile therein, as that they may haue the worde of God dwell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in themſelues plentifully in all wiſedome. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. that ſo according to the commended example of the noble men of <hi>Baerea Act.</hi> 17.11. and the doctrine of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> they may trie the ſpirits of them that would ſeeme to teach them a right, before they beleeue them, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.15. we confeſſe gladly with <hi>Peter</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt. cap.</hi> 1. 20. 21. that no propheſie nor part of the ſcripture, is of any priuate interpretation, and all ſuch interpretations we count and iudge pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and humane (whoſoeuer gyues or allowes them) that are not indeede ſoundly agreeing with the minde of the authour of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the holy Ghoſt.

Now this ſound ſence of the ſcripture we take onely to be that, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof thereby intended, for the better finding out whereof, after inuocation and praier vnto God, for the direction of his ſpirit, to leade vs aright thereunto, wee thinke it very neceſſarie, that no good meanes that we can haue vſe of, be omitted.

In alleadging of them this courſe we take, to make it appeare, that by the ſound rules of interpreting the ſcriptures, they are rightly cited by vs; wee ſtand not therefore vpon the bare and onely cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, howſoeuer that be (as you would inſinuate) but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right and ſound alleadging thereof; which you can neuer proue, is common to vs with other heretiques. For howſoeuer they and you ioyne with vs in often alleadging the Scriptures for your defence, yet neither they nor you, ioyne with vs in right alleadging of them, in that you and they alleadge them for the maintenance of your errours and hereſies, contrary to the true ſence thereof, and the ſound rules of interpreting of them, and we accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true ſence of the Catholicke church, ſtanding well with thoſe rules, to confirme the Catholicke faith. And yet (as I ſaied) to this ende ſerueth what ſoeuer you haue writen in this Chapter, and in three or foure moe following, namely to proue, <hi>that the deuill, &amp; heretiques, and others</hi> (as you write) <hi>haue by wreſting &amp; wrong interpreting the ſcriptures alwaies laboured to countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their hereſies.</hi> This we graunt to be moſt true you ſee, &amp; yet thereby you haue gained nothing againſt vs. For we ſtand ſtill vpon this, &amp; may doe for all this, that if we haue the Scriptures indeede in true ſence on our ſide, thereby we and our doings are ſo ſufficiently iuſtified, as that we neede no further iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fiue Chapters, as they tend to the proofe of one and ſelfe-ſame matter, ſo haue I thought good ioyntly to frame an anſwere to them togither. Be it graunted therefore vnto you, that all theſe heretiques (as you haue writen and reported of them) alleadged the Scripture and conſequently (as hereupon you inferre <hi>cap.</hi> 26.) <hi>that one may ſee, how the ill diſpoſed may alleage ſcripture, in a corrupt ſence, to maintaine ſuch hereſie, as theſe.</hi> To what ende haue you done all this? It appeareth <hi>chap.</hi> 22. you entered firſt into this diſcourſe, to proue, that though we haue the ſcripture on our ſide, which we alleadge, yet we are not therby ſufficiently defended: and now hereupon onely you would inferre &amp; conclude, that a man may ſee, how the ill diſpoſed may alleadge Scripture in a corrupt ſence, to confirme ſuch hereſies, as theſe: which we graunt to be moſt euident: and yet it remaineth vndiſproued, that if we haue the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18269:155"/> Scripture, which we alleadge, on our ſide, we are thereby ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended. For none of theſe, nor any that alleadged Scripture. as they did, though they alleadge the words of the ſcripture, haue the ſcripture indeede on their ſides: becauſe if a man haue not the true ſence thereof on his ſide, he hath not the ſcripture indeede and trueth on his ſide.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will ſay, that you intended onely in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, that you haue gathered thereupon, &amp; ſet downe in the beginning of your 26. Chapter: then ſay I, you made an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt your ſelues in our name <hi>cap.</hi> 22. which you thought to heauy &amp; harde for you, &amp; therefore you thought good, thus to ſlip fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it by and by againe. For you were neuer ſo ſimple, as to thinke, that we were of that opinion, that we accounted our ſelues to haue thoſe ſcriptures, which wee alleadged on our ſide to iuſtifie vs &amp; our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the bare alleadging of the words, how far ſoeuer we were from the true meaning. But you beginne in your 26. to tell vs, what further meaning you haue had therein, as namely, hereby to warne the ſimple people, that they ſhould not giue eare vnto falſe paſtours, that haue nothing in their mouthes but the ſcripture, &amp; the pure word of God And hereupon you take occaſion moſt earneſtly to perſwade thoſe, that are not much vſed to reade the Scriptures, nor to heare how the church &amp; the doctours doe expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the hard pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to beware how they reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for fear of falling into errour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede as long as you would haue them hereby onely to take heede of raſh crediting falſe paſtours, which would countenance their damnable doctrine with ſuch allegations; I like well, and allow of your warning hereupon giuen againſt ſuch: but then I can aſſure you this withall, that rather your Popes, Biſhops, &amp; paſtours will be found theſe falſe paſtours, then they whom you meane. I like alſo very well, that not only ſuch as you ſpeake of, but further that men of all ſorts, how much ſoeuer exerciſed in the reading of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or acquainted with the expoſition of the Church or doctours, ſhould be at all times wary and carefull in reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in what ſence they take them. For I graunt (as you inferre) that if ſo many men of great learning haue ſo dangerouſlie miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, it is poſſible enough, that men that haue little ſkill or none at all, may as dangerouſly miſunderſtande them. But yet vpon theſe wordes, either to diſcourage the paſtour from countenancing and defending his true doctrine, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18269:156"/> &amp; pure word of God, or to diſcourage the ſimple people from reading and ſtudying the Scriptures (which I feare herein was your ſecrete purpoſe, though for ſhame you durſt not plainely ſet it downe) I tell you is deuiliſh and Antichriſtian. For though it be true, that the deuill for wicked purpoſe (as you note in you twenty two Chapter) alleadged ſcripture to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. and all theſe heretiques alleadged ſcripture for the countenancing of their damnable hereſies, yet that droue not Chriſt, nor true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from alleadging the ſcriptures to confute them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the trueth, as it appeareth by Chriſtes anſwere to <hi>Sathan Mat.</hi> 4. and by the writings of the ancient fathers againſt theſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. And the hardneſſe that it hath pleaſed God to leaue in the Scriptures is not ſuch, but as that notwithſtanding, the ſimpleſt may reade and trauell in the Scriptures with great profit, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it pleaſeth you to inſinuate in your taunting maner (<hi>ca.</hi> 26.) that artificers may not haue the ſpirit of God and bee profitable readers and vnderſtanders thereof. For euery one that would be bleſſed, is to take delight in the lawe of god, and to ſhew that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, by meditating therein day &amp; night. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1. and Chriſt hath commanded all his hearers indifferently, to ſearch the ſcriptures <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. And for all the hardnes, that is in them, we reade, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>that the teſtimonie of the Lord giueth wiſedome vnto the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his commandements giue light vnto the eies.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy ghoſt in <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking of the ſcriptures of the olde Teſtament (which were then harder, then they be now, being ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened as they be now by the acceſſe of the new Teſtament) ſaieth thus, <hi>Thy word is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light to my paths, Pſal.</hi> 119.

And as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as you are at this point, whatſoeuer you haue ſaid of heretiques abuſing of ſcripture, as though you were the only men that had care rightly to vſe them &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them, euery ſimple body may ſee, that of all men you are they, by the variablenes of your Romiſh church practiſe, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are moſt likely to make a noſe of waxe, and leaden rule both of the letter of the ſcriptures, and ſence thereof. And therefore whereas in your 23. <hi>c.</hi> you boldly affirme, that to draw the ſcriptures by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into a wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſence, is the maner of interpreting the ſcriptures, called at this day the pure word, by thoſe that haue profeſſed as long as they liue to be enemies to the trueth, moſt fitly may be vnderſtoode of your ſelues; for you are ſo in loue with the preſent practiſe, faſhion and opinion of your Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, that though that vary neuer ſo often, euen ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt the ſcriptures will they, nill they, vary and alter their ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit I am not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that in ſo writing you meant vs, though I am ſure you ſhall neuer be able to proue vs, either to haue profeſſed at all any enmity w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the truth, or ſo to vſe to wreſt the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But becauſe this is a matter of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and therfore ſuch as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be determined, either by your yea, or our nay, it ſhal not be amiſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rules of interpreting there be, that by the ſame it may be tried, whither your interpreting of the ſcriptures or ours, deſerue thus to be called a drawing of the ſcriptures by violence to a corrupt ſence. The vniforme conſent of doctors you would ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeme (as I haue ſaied) in this caſe to make reckoning of, as of a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and Apoſtolicke rule of interpreting them by, but this is but for a faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for you haue giuen vs &amp; doe daily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt proofes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but one or two againſt all the reſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and preſent practiſe of your Roman church y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now is, that that one or two of them ouer wey w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you al the reſt. And beſides, if this were a neceſſary rule, then none could be interpreters of the ſcriptures, but thoſe that had all or the moſt part of the doctours to peruſe, few or none, then ancient doctors &amp; writers there haue beene ſo many, &amp; their names are ſo vnknowen to moſt, could be ſure when they had the conſent of the moſt and beſt on their ſide, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould be ſure of the ſence: and for many places very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing oftentimes haue they writen. Though therefore we will not ſhunne the trial of our interpretations w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you by this rule, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe more certaine rules &amp; helps to finde out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ſence: firſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18269:160"/> that the true Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maticall ſence of the words, and ſpeech vſed by the holy ghoſt bee ſoundly and rightly vnderſtoode by ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Grammer &amp; Rhetoricke, for the natiue ſignification of the words and vſe of the phraſe: whereunto much helpeth conference of tranſlation with tranſlation: &amp; of all tranſtations (if neede be) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the originall tongues. Secondly, that diligent conſideration be had of the circumſtances of the text in hand, as namely, what is the matter &amp; ſcope thereof, vpon what occaſion it was vttered, who vttered it, to whom, where, &amp; when. Thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be taken in ſuch a ſence, as will agree beſt with theſe circumſtances, and ſtand well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſcripture. And laſtly, that no ſence be admitted, but that which will ſtand w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſound proportion and ſumme of Chriſtian faith, and good maners, taught vs plainely elſewhere in the ſcriptures. By theſe rules we doubt not but to iuſtifie &amp; approue that to be the true ſence of the ſcriptures, which we take them in, either for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the trueth, which we holde; or for the confutation of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which you defend. And ſuch rules they are, as the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in defending the ancient Catholique faith againſt heretiques, haue alwaies vſed, and no other, as appeareth in their workes. And ſuch they are, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his bookes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine doeth preſcribe, as moſt neceſſary in this caſe to be followed, as no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can, or ought to make any exception againſt. And yet ſuch they are; as would anone diſcouer the ridiculous vanity of your interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in any controuerſie betwixt vs and you. For example, let vs try here by your interpretation of <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which to be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you will liue and die in. By what grammer, or by helpe of what tongue, or tranſlation ſhall the word <hi>Eſt,</hi> is, be all one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>tranſubſtantiatur in,</hi> is tranſubſtantiated into? Sure I am in no language, nor in anie Dictionarie ſhall you euer finde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verbe Subſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſenſe. Secondly, the matter in hand, when thoſe words were vttered, was a ſacrament, &amp; Chriſt ſpake them to his Apoſtles at his laſt ſupper, to the ende, to inſtitute a ſacrament, to continue a duetifull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his death, vntill his ſecond comming. What reaſon is there then to the contrarie, but that this ſpeech ſhould be taken, as the like ſpeech alwaies els hath beene, and yet is in other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Where, <hi>Eſt,</hi> is neuer taken (coupling the ſigne and the thing ſigned togither, whereof a Sacrament conſiſteth) as you doe here, for, <hi>It is turned into,</hi> but for, <hi>ſignifieth;</hi> which ſtandeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo well with the nature of a Sacrament: whereas yours ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18269:160"/> the nature thereof, in ſo annihilating or tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſigne, that you leaue no ſigne to beare any analogie of the thing reſembled, which is the ground of ſuch Sacramentall phraſes. Thirdly, your ſence agreeth not with the reſt of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not onely in that in the whole bodie of the Scriptures, you cannot finde <hi>Eſt,</hi> Is, placed (as it is here) betwixt two thinges of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe kindes, as breade and body be, taken in your ſence: and yet in ſuch propoſitious you finde it vſually taken for it ſignifieth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth: but alſo in that the ſcripture (for all that ſpeech) calleth it bread ſtill, euen whiles it is in eating, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> and expoundeth the eating thereof to bee a communion, or partaking with, or of the body of Chriſt, and that ſpirituall, not by corporall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Laſtly, your interpretation for the bringing in, &amp; eſtabliſhing of a corporall &amp; reall eating of Chriſt, with the mouth of the bodie (which is a thing neuer taught vs in the word, &amp; but ſuch a kinde of feeding on him, as you your ſelues confeſſe <hi>Iudas,</hi> and ſuch may atteine vnto, and be neuer the better) ſhaketh, yea ſubuerteth al thoſe articles, that concerne Chriſts true manhoode, making him to haue (euen for that needles preſence ſake) a body without any of the eſſential and inſeparable properties of a body: yea at one &amp; ſelfeſame time, to haue a body viſible, ſenſible, and locall in heauen; &amp; yet inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inſenſible, and without dimentions of place in earth. Beſides it is againſt good maners, which forbiddeth eating of mans fleſh, and drinking of his bloud, either openly or ſecretly couered vnder, or in another thing And truely <hi>Auerroes</hi> had ſome reaſon, of all men in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to thinke ſuch Chriſtians, as you, the moſt ſauage and fooliſh, that firſt would fal downe, &amp; worſhip a peece of bread for your God, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue ſo done eate him vp, and deuour him. Howſoeuer you pleaſe your ſelues in this interpretation, and in your imagination grounded thereupon, I am fully perſwaded, that this, &amp; your multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of images and idols are two of the principall cauſes, whereby you haue hardened the hearts both of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion. And (as I haue read) ſome of them haue to ſome of your fellowes, being in hand to perſwade them to turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Religion to yours, yeelded theſe two reaſons, why they thought yours worſe, then their owne, and conſequently as ſufficient cauſe, why they would not yeelde to yours.</p>
                  <p>Now if I ſhould but barely recite a number of other your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and collections of the ſcripture, which yet with you go
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18269:161"/> for very ſound and Catholique interpretations, &amp; collections, I am ſure, it were ſufficient to make euery reader thereof, that hath anie witte or diſcrecion left him, to thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were neuer heretiques in the world, that haue more fondly &amp; vainely interpreted the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then you. For example, let the reader marke theſe for a taſt. <hi>God made two great lights, the ſunne &amp; the moone:</hi> that is, the <hi>Pope &amp; the Emperour:</hi> &amp; therefore as many degrees as the moone is inferiour to the ſonne, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour inferiour to the Pope: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: de Maioritate &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; Gloſsa, Ibid.

Euery one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill doeth, hateth the light, &amp; commeth not to the light, leaſt his deedes be reproued. Yea <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> in his 7. booke teſtifieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope ſuffred the Legates of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> being proſtrate before him, to ſay vnto him, <hi>Qui tollis peccata mundi,</hi> Thou which takeſt away the ſins of the world, haue mercy vpon vs: Thou which takeſt away the ſins of the world, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs peace: thus blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to the Pope, which belongeth to Chriſt.

And therefore it is, that we tell you, that your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, though they be countenanced with Popes, doctours, and councels, and what els you will, yet are to be reiected as priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, vnles they be warranted by the teſtimony and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Doeth not Gods ſpirit dwell indeede in ſuch, yea and in none but ſuch? Now whereas you thinke, that if you ſhould aſke vs againe, where were thoſe faithfull ones, our anſwere onelie would bee, where the holy Ghoſt was, and that wee could giue you no direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwere: and ſo thereat you take your pleaſure, ſaying, that that is to plaie handie, dandie, &amp;c: though if wee ſhould anſwere you no otherwiſe, we might doe ſo with better reaſon, then your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier in <hi>Hoſius,</hi> ſo much commended by him, and ſome of you elſe might anſwere, as he did, who when he was aſked, how he did beleeue, anſwered, as the Church beleeueth: and being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how the Church beleeued, anſwered, as I beleeue. For the Scripture doeth expreſſely binde vs, when wee are called, to anſwere for our faith, that wee ſhould yeelde a reaſon thereof: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and ſo it bindeth vs not, to bee alwaies able to make demonſtration, who bee the faithfull, and where they dwell from time to time: yet you vnderſtand well enough (if you were diſpoſed) that wee both can, and haue giuen you a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler anſwere, and that wee haue tolde both the names of the moſt famous perſons, and alſo where they and their followers haue liued, and dwelt, that beleeued as wee doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the holie Ghoſt as well as wee. But to let your gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing go, if in earneſt you would haue it tried, whither in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Scriptures you or wee haue the holie Ghoſt, and ſo conſequently, whither you or wee bee liker theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques (you ſpeake of) in miſinterpreting the Scriptures: your interpretations and ours muſt bee examined, which will ſtande beſt with the reſt of the Scriptures, wherein we are ſure, the holie Ghoſt hath ſpoken: and ſo they, whoſe interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are found beſt to agree therewith, ſentence muſt bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on their ſide, that they haue the holie Ghoſt, and that the other haue it not. For <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writing of the holie Ghoſt gaue this rule, to trie whither <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> had this ſpirit, or no, as they bragged: and hereby hee proueth, <hi>that Chriſt taught by this ſpirit, becauſe hee confirmed his doctrine out of the Lawe and the Prophets, whereas the falſe teachers could not doe ſo.</hi> Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18269:163"/> alſo by his owne example hath taught vs, when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is betwixt two, about the ſence of a ſentence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea, though hee that bringeth the wrong ſence, be the verie Deuill himſelfe, that this is the next, beſt, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narieſt waie, to ſtoppe his mouth, and to make it appeare, that hee hath brought a wrong ſence, to ſee, whither it will ſtande with ſome other plaine place of Scripture or no. For when the Deuill had alleadged the ninetie one Pſalme in this ſence, that the meaning thereof was, that though Chriſt ſhould throwe himſelfe downe head-long, yet his fathers promiſe was, that hee ſhould take no harme, becauſe by this ſence, ſathan would haue perſwaded him, vpon preſumption vpon his fathers prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to haue tempted him: Chriſt proueth, that that could not bee the ſence of the place; becauſe it was writen (as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> And with this anſwere ſathan, as cunning and malitious, as he was, gaue ouer to replie any further, for the iuſtifying of his ſence, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.7.

And therefore they haue giuen vs rules, to helpe vs in this caſe, as for example; <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> hath giuen vs this, <hi>Fewer places muſt bee expounded by the more. Auguſtine</hi> this, <hi>The circumſtance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is woonte to giue light, and open the meaning,</hi> in his booke of Queſtions, <hi>quaeſt:</hi> 69. <hi>Darke places are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18269:164"/> by more plaine places; that is the ſureſt way of declaring the ſcriptures, to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one ſcripture by another:</hi> in his 3. booke of Chriſtian doctrine, <hi>cap.</hi> 26. and in thoſe bookes writen of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine many moe very profitable.

Chriſt and his Apoſtles were contented to put themſelues, for triall of their doings, to this, but your Popes thinke ſcorne to looke ſo lowe: yea rather they will haue all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, wherein they are principall parties themſelues, tryed by themſelues, and you and they crie out, that this is not the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to ende ſuch queſtions. But who is ſo madde, as to thinke, that you can finde out a better way, then Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles vſed? You will ſend vs (ſay ſome of you) for the triall of theſe matters vnto the doctours, and councels, and yet when it commeth to the point, vnles they and their ſayings pleaſe you, yee reiect them alſo. And you cannot denie, but that oftentimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is farre more diſputable and doubtfull, what was their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then what is the meaning of the Scripture: and you know alſo, that it is an vſuall thing with them, to ſende vs backe againe to the Scriptures, for triall of their writings, as it appeareth in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> 19. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>Hirom,</hi> and in his 111. <hi>Epiſt,</hi> to <hi>Fortunatian.</hi> And therefore indeede (ſay you what you will) this is the ſafeſt, ſureſt, and readieſt way of triall of this and all other matters in queſtion betwixt vs, to bring all to the touchſtone of the ſcriptures. I would to God therfore, that once you would giue ouer al other bie, and indirect trials, and come onely to this: for then it would quickely appeare, euen to the ſimple, whither you, or wee were rather to be followed. For all this, we ioyne with you in the later ende of your twenty three Chapter, in warning men to take heede, that they doe not raſhly beleeue &amp; follow euery one, that will pretend, that they haue the ſcriptures on their ſide.

                  <p>In your recitall of the heretiques abuſing the ſcriptures, diuers things ſlipt from you alſo worthy the noting, namely theſe, that you could not content your ſelfe, with ſhewing vs, how they did abuſe the Scriptures, in wrong alleaging them, but that (as though your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itched to ſhew, that you had as good ſkill therein, as they) you ſtill intermingle with theirs your owne cunning, in ſhewing how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places might be abuſed in like maner, neither confuting in the ende their collections, nor your owne, how dangerous ſoeuer.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, I ſaie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thus ſaying, you haue ſhewed your malice &amp; boldnes more, then any thing elſe: for you haue therin vttered nothing, but a blind prophets drea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and fanſie, which no man of any wiſedome or diſcretion wil make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reckoning of. It is wel yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth, hath enforced you here to confeſſe, that it maie be ſeene in al the ancient eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers, that the doctours fully anſwered by texts of ſcripture, theſe old hereſies by you before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned. For euen therby you maie ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though heretickes neuer ſo much miſaleage ſcripture, that yet the true miniſters of the Lord, may &amp; muſt alleage them, euen to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute their hereſies by. And therfore it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſtil firme, that if we, by alleaging of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aright ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue you heretickes, &amp; your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we ſtriue againſt, hereſies (which no further then we can doe, we neuer craue anie credit to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs) whatſoeuer you would ſeeme to haue ſaied, to beat vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleaging of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it appears that therby both we, our doings and religion are ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly iuſtified, both before God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe miſalegers of ſcripture which in al theſe Chapters you haue ſpoken of, you ſaie, you will not ſtaie to confute, for two cauſes, becauſe they raigne not now, and their hereſies togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authours therof are periſhed, &amp; becauſe the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed them as you ſaie: but indeed the reaſon was, that you were loth to occupie either your ſelfe or reader, in ſo profitable a matter. It ſemeth you tooke more delight, in ſhewing how the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18269:165"/> might be miſalleaged, to fortifie hereſie, then how rightlie allea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute the ſame, and therfore you could find leaſure to ſtay 4. or 5 Chap. in that, but not at al vpon this. Beſides, if it be true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue reported (if you had wel reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred your ſelfe) you would not ſo generally haue ſaied, that they were al periſhed. For read your Chap. ouer again, and you ſhal finde, that therin you haue ſpoken of ſome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not ſo quite dead and periſhed, but that euen in theſe daies they need to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed. But you ſay, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue here noted, either of them or of their hereſies and their alleaging of ſcripture for the ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, you haue done it onely to giue warning to ſimple people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not too raſhly giue ear to falſe paſtors, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue nothing in their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, but the holy ſcripture and the pure word of God, ſo couering the cups of their poiſon, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gold and pretious ſtones w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the image of the eternal king, to paint thoſe ſubtil foxes, that will lead them al to da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If you had indeed done it onely to this end, you had not bene to be miſliked: but in deed and trueth, you haue done it, to breed in men a careleſnes and negligence in ſearching the ſcriptures, and a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of alleaging the ſame, to determine the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies betwixt vs and you. Otherwiſe thinke as you ſpeake, and we are ready to ioine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you both in this, &amp; alſo in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which you adde, in wiſhing the ſimple and vnlearned in reading the harde places, to take heed they fal not into error, by taking onelie the letter &amp;c. For if great learned men thereby haue bene endangered, how much more may ſuch. But ſurely this is rather a caue at meet and needful for you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs, if we go no further, but to your peeuiſh taking of the letter of <hi>hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> contrary to al ſound rules of right interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as I haue ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>Now, wheras hereupon you take occaſion, according to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ieere at our miniſtry, as though in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> &amp; <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> eſpecially it were generally vnlearned, and conſiſted of the baſeſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of the people: you are worthy of ſmal anſwere, your ſpeech there about is ſo appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly falſe &amp; ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous. For, God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, in both kingdoms, you your ſelues are enforced to feele (to your whole kingdoms griefe and deadly wound in the end I doubt not) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are great ſtore of learned miniſters and biſhops, far other maner of men, then you haue named. And therfore your own conſcience could not but tel you, vnles it were ſeared with a hoate iron, that they doe in neither kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the guiding of the ſterne, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to al kinde of people. In both places, both their doctrine &amp; publicke order of their churches aimeth at a learned &amp; godly miniſtry: wherof
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18269:166"/> if in ſome particulers they faile (which in ſo great a multitude and compaſſe altogither cannot bee auoided) the faulte is to bee laied in the particuler men, by whoſe negligence or corruption it ſo commeth to paſſe, and not in either of the churches, which would gladly, that no ſuch fault ſhould at all be committed. Howbeit I dare ſay, howſoeuer you ruffle in your tearms of pedlers Coblers, Tanners, Bankerouts and raunagates, and ſay that ſuch be our interpreters of the ſcriptures, and that we hold euery ſuch one, once admitted by a biſhop to be a miniſter, to haue the ſpirit, and to be great doctours, to whom no place of ſcripture is too hard, becauſe they can rayle of the Pope, ſay al the ancient doctours were men, and the generall councels did erre: that yet you can neither proue our miniſters to be ſuch, nor that for theſe balde reaſons, wee thinke any ſo qualified as you write. It pleaſed you but in this, to ſhew your ſpitefull and malicious ſpirit: but alas who will thinke (doe you what you can) that you indeed miſlike a baſe and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miniſtry, who not onely haue held (and yet haue as great cauſe ſo to doe ſtil as euer) that ignorance is the mother of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon that ground, haue all your Church ſeruice in a tongue, that the people ſhall not vnderſtand, and content your ſelues, for the moſt part with ſuch prieſts, as can ſcarſely rightly read the ſame. Truely, if there had bene but a crumme of right modeſty &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes in you, knowing as you doe, the notorious baſenes, groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ignorance of your ordinary maſſe-prieſtes, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue taken this pleaſure, that it ſeemeth you did, in thus railing on, defacing and ſlandering of ours.</p>
                  <p>Indeed by that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. (by you quoted <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.) when we ſee what grace and giftes of knowledge God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amongſt vs beſtoweth vpon ſuch: in the meane time, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in what great blindnes and errour a number of great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins and doctours amongſt you walke on ſtill, we take occaſion (as Chriſt hath taught vs) to giue thankes to our heauenly father, that hath reuealed theſe thinges vnto babes, which yet your great wiſe men, and men of vnderſtanding, ſee not. But you would not haue vs by this place to defend, that ſuch meane men may come to be cunning and ſkilfull in the Scriptures. Your reaſons are two, <hi>for that other heretiques haue ſo alleadged it; and for that this is to be vnderſtood of the humble in ſpirit, whereas theſe men of ours, truſt to their owne wittes, and are puft vp with arrogant ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18269:166"/> &amp;c.</hi> You thought good yet neither to tell vs what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, when, nor where: howſoeuer, you knowe (I truſt) that men muſt not ſhame wel to vſe that Scripture, that heretiques haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed. Concerning your other reaſon, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you, the place is to be vnderſtood onely of the humble and meeke in ſpirit, and whoſoeuer a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt vs come vnto the ſcriptures, truſting to their owne wittes, and ſo puft vp with ignorance (as you ſpeake) we vtterly miſlike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as you. But that you ſhoulde giue forth this ſentence of yours in ſuch general tearmes, againſt ſimple &amp; poore men amongſt vs, that trauell in the Scriptures, you had neither reaſon, nor chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſo doing. Commonly ſuch raſh iudging of others, proceedeth from a minde euen ſo qualified, as you charge theirs to be, and from no other fountaine. And who ſo conſidereth their groſſe ignorance, and errors, that remaine in your great Clerkes, euerie where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ſcriptures (what other learning ſoeuer they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) he hath moſt iuſt occaſion thereby to iudge, that either they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the ſcriptures verie little, or els that they come to them with the mindes you talke of.</p>
                  <p>And if you woulde tell vs plainelie, what you meane by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of ſpirit (which in this caſe you ſpeake of) wee ſhould ſoone perceiue, that thereby you vnderſtand not true Chriſtian hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which through a baſe conceite that it breedeth in the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſtirreth him vp the more earneſtlie to craue aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, and by diligent ſearch of the Scriptures, and more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of all good meanes, to compaſſe the right vnderſtanding of them: but a popiſh and ſlauiſh kinde of humilitie, which muſt breede in the owner ſuch a ſeruile depending vpon your Popes will, and Churches tradition for the ſence thereof, as that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no ſence at al of them (though thruſt vpon him neuer ſo plainelie by the euidence of the place) that will not fullie agree therewith. Which breedeth in all of your ſide, either a flat giuing ouer all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, or els ſuch a reading of them, as that they muſt bring a ſence vnto them from the tradition of your Church, and ſo enforce that vpon them, whither they will or no, for howſoeuer the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeake, the Churches tradition maie not be contraried. This is your humblenes of ſpirit, when you haue brought Gods ſpirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Scriptures in ſubiection vnto your popiſh ſpirit: but this is a proud humilitie, and a curſed meekenes. You doe but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſlie ſlander vs, in that you would perſwade your reader, that

For you know, that the learned knowe, that both fathers and councels haue erred, &amp; that you your owne ſelues, when they write or determine any thing which you like not, wil and doe as plainelie as we acknowledge the ſame. For which point let a man read <hi>Andrad.</hi> firſt booke writen in defence of the Tridentine faith, and but what <hi>Pighius</hi> hath writen of purpoſe for ſuch cauſe, to diſcredit the ſixt and ſeuenth Sinods, and hee ſhall moſt plainelie perceiue, that councels are of no further cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with you, then they ſhall be found to ſay nothing to your miſlike. But to make it cleare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is no abſurditie to ſay or hold, that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels and fathers may erre, and haue erred: it is wel knowen, that as the firſt <hi>Nicean</hi> councell and ſundry after, accordingly decreed a right, againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> for the trueth of Chriſts manhood, ſo the <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the <hi>Sirmienſe,</hi> the <hi>Ariminenſe,</hi> the <hi>Sebucian</hi> and the <hi>Antioche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For to what

Deny therefore that he hath executed that office, and you deny the cauſe of his comming. And you know, <hi>ſublatâ cauſâ tollitur effectus:</hi> deny the cauſe and the effect is denied. I knowe you will thinke, that I offer you great wrong, in charging you thus directly with denying Chriſt of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: but if you will haue patience a little, if I proue it not, let me haue the ſhame thereof. You will ſay for your defence, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and acknowledge him to be the Sauiour and redeemer of the world: and you will ſay, you beleeue by him to be ſaued: I doe not deny, but you will and doe ſay all this, and more alſo; but what is that to the purpoſe, as long as in your deedes and practiſe you go from it againe, and robbe him of that honour, that is due vnto him? <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaied vnto him, <hi>Haile maſter, and kiſſed him,</hi> when indeede he betraied him: and <hi>Pilat</hi> wrote him, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth king of the Iewes,</hi> and yet crucified him. But to come nearer vnto you, it cannot be denied, but that the falſe Apoſtles, that gaue <hi>Paul</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to write to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> did not deny theſe things, which you giue out in wordes of Chriſt, this onely was their fault, that they taught men to ioyne their owne merits, atteined vnto by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, togither with Chriſt in the office of iuſtifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it moſt clearely appeareth, throughout that Epiſtle. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of which conceite in their obſeruations of <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, and namely in being circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed (for otherwiſe in the ſame place he ſaieth, <hi>neither circumciſion, nor vncircumciſion auaileth any thing</hi>) hee telleth them moſt confidently chap. <hi>5. that Chriſt ſhould profitte them nothing:</hi> yea, <hi>that they were aboliſhed from Chriſt and fallen from grace.</hi> Whereupon moſt euidently it followeth, that <hi>Paul</hi> was of this minde, that howſoeuer the lawe was obſerued of them that beleeued in Chriſt, it might not be obſerued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this minde and to this ende, thereby together with Chriſt to iuſtifie the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. You cannot ſay, that heere <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of obſeruing the lawe, to this ende before they had faith. For he ſpeaketh to ſuch, as after they had by his miniſtry attained vnto faith in Chriſt, were now taught by falſe teachers, to ioyne their owne merits in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, with Chriſt in iuſtifying. But yet you ſay, he ſpeaketh in this, and in ſuch places onely of the workes of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law, which was then aboliſhed: wherein you ſay more, then you can proue. For he ſo excludeth workes from this office of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18269:170"/> that he oft aduoutcheth, that iuſtification commeth freely, as <hi>Rom. 3. Epheſ. 2.</hi> and he calleth ſaluation the free gift of God, <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> and therefore as little commeth it for morall workes ſake, as for Ceremoniall. But though you could proue, that he diſableth onely Ceremoniall workes, yet you could not eſcape the ſentence ſet downe by the Apoſtle againſt ſuch, as doe them to the end aforeſaied. Yes, ſay you, for we doe not teach men to obſerue them at all, much leſſe to any ſuch ende. What then? you haue deuiled a number of Ceremoniall workes of your owne, <hi>as the obſeruing of holy daies, and faſting daies, going on pilgrimage, offring to this ſhrine, &amp; that, taking of holy water, creeping to the Croſſe, wearing of this thing and that, and a thouſand ſuch other,</hi> which you perſwade men and women to obſerue, with as great an opinion to merit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as euer the falſe Apoſtles taught either <hi>Galathians, Coloſsians,</hi> or any other to obſerue <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonies. And you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth to the <hi>Col. cap. 2. that ſeeing they were in Chriſt freed from the ceremonies of Moſes law,</hi> which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ther, <hi>the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the world,</hi> much more they ought to take themſelues freed from traditions, <hi>touch not, taſt not, handle not,</hi> and very reaſon will tell you, that if in <hi>Pauls</hi> time it were a denying and renouncing of Chriſt, to obſerue the Ceremonies, that God himſelfe had appointed once, and which ſo long by his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance had beene kept in the Church, with that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereby to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with Chriſt to be iuſtified: much more is it ſo, to obſerue theſe beggerly Ceremoniall ordinances of yours, which yet neuer had any allowance from God, but doe flatly contrarie his will in his word. I knowe you <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue taught you yet one ſhift more, and that is this; that you haue not any ſuch opinion in your works morall or Ceremoniall, nor in any thing els, that you doe, or vſe, wherein you haue opinion of merit, for their owne dignity, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines conſidered in themſelues, but for that they are <hi>tincta ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Chriſti,</hi> that is, aduanced to that force and dignity thorowe the force of the death and paſſion of Chriſt.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18269:171"/> moſt righteous workes done by the faithfull after regeneration, the office of iuſtifying (as it may appeare, in that <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes and <hi>Pauls,</hi> when they were in that ſtate, though they were neuer ſo full of them, are diſallowed to haue any ſuch effect. <hi>Rom. 4.2. Phil. 3.8.9.</hi>) ſo doeth it teach vs, that Chriſt came not, to make other perſons or things to haue the office of ſauing mens ſoules, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne and go thorowe that worke ſo himſelfe, as that no part of that glory ſhal be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to any other perſon, or thing. For therein we reade, <hi>that his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree: &amp; that by his ſtripes wee are healed. 1. Pet. 2.24.</hi> &amp; ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that it is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Heb. 10.14. we are ſanctified by the offring of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made, &amp; with one offering hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated for euer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſanctified.</hi> Whereupon he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe <hi>Alpha &amp; Omega, Reuel: 1.11.</hi> that is, the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and laſt accompliſher of our ſaluation, or as it is ſaied <hi>Hebr. 12. the authour and finiſher of our faith.</hi> Whereas by this newe Ieſuiticall diuinity, in the matter of iuſtification, and ſaluation, Chriſt hath but ſo borne our ſinnes in his owne bodie and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to death for vs, that howſoeuer thereby hee hath begunne to heale and cure vs, the ending and finiſhing it, muſt be by thoſe other thinges, and he hath done all this to no purpoſe, vnles his worke begunne be ended by theſe things following, in our ſelues and others.</p>
                  <p>O what intollerable blaſphemie is this! and into what a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les pitte of deſperation doe theſe men, the authours of this doctrine, wilfully caſt themſelues! For if the caſe ſtand ſo, as they ſay, how is it poſſible for any man at any time euer to haue a faith without wauering? which kinde of faith <hi>S. Iames</hi> determineth to be fruitles. <hi>Iam. 1.</hi> For when can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tell, that he hath hit of all thoſe things, that are left beſides Chriſts merits, to accompliſh the full merit for his ſaluation? Or how can the ſoule of man ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, without any warrant from God, and contrary to all reaſon, perſwade it ſelfe, that it ſhall haue heauen for theſe things, ſo full of imperfection and vanity, if not impiety? Further, to proue that you deny Chriſt his owne office, and pinne vpon him an office of your owne deuiſing, it appeareth alſo in this, that you will not let him be King, Prophet, &amp; Prieſt to his Church, as the ſcriptures teach him to bee. For neither will you ſuffer him to gouerne his kingdome, according to his owne orders, neither to teach his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18269:172"/> people onely with his own word, nor to ſaue them onely by his own obedience and merits. But in all theſe you croſſe him, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a number of faſhions, lawes, and ordinances, yea officers, and offices into his houſe, that he neuer ſaied Amen vnto, in teaching men rather the traditions and inuentions of men, then doctrine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hath warrant from his mouth, and in ſetting vp a number of meanes to ſaluation beſides him.</p>
                  <p>Now as for vs, wee neither with the ancient heretiques, nor yet with you hold any hereſie concerning either his perſon, or office. For concerning the one, we holde and beleeue, that he is perfect God, and perfect man, and yet but one perſon conſiſting of thoſe two natures: and concerning the other, that he is ſuch a Sauiour, as that he hath begun and finiſhed whatſoeuer was neceſſary to merite or deſerue our full ſaluation by. And therefore when we haue done al the good workes, that poſſibly by his grace we can, yet, though we know and beleeue that God will both accept of vs, &amp; of thoſe our good workes for his Chriſtes ſake, for feare of robbing him of any part of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that he tooke vpon him, we dare not thinke, that therby we haue any maner of way merited any part of our ſaluation. That onely we ſeeke at his hands, and through him and his merits alone we looke for it. This doctrine in euery point hath warrant from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and from all ſound antiquity. And this and the reſt of our whole doctrine tendeth greatly to aduaunce the glory of God, both in ſetting forth the ſeuerity of his iuſtice againſt ſin, euen to the leaſt ſin, and the infinitenes of his free mercy in Chriſt: and altogither to throw downe man vnder the burden of his ſinnes, both original and actual, that he may ſeeke to riſe againe not at all by any ſtrength of his owne, but onely by the grace of God in Chriſt Ieſus. Whereas yours contrarily tendeth to this end, to lift vp man in a conceit of himſelfe, and to abſcure both the iuſtice, and the mercy of God: As your doctrines of free will, mans ability to keepe and ouerkeepe the law: of veniall ſinnes, euen for the littlenes of them, and of mans owne iuſtifying of himſelfe, may make moſt euident to them, that conſider of them. And therfore ſeeing it is writen, <hi>that God reſiſteth the proude, &amp; giueth grace to the humble: Iames. 4.6.</hi> and that it is his property, <hi>to ſend away the rich empty, and to fill the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with good thinges, Luk. 1.53, &amp; to iuſtifie the publican, &amp; to ſende the phariſie home without: Luk. 15.</hi> a great ſigne this is, yea a good proofe, that we, rather then you, are led by the ſpirit of God.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18269:172"/> And as for theſe olde heretiques, you are bound to beleeue vs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then them, becauſe our doctrine not onely by the teſtimony of the Scriptures, but alſo (I dare ſay) euen in your owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is ſounder both concerning the perſon and office of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> then theirs: and thus you are anſwered both to your firſt, and ſecond queſtion, which you put vnto vs in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But yet you go on, and ſay, <hi>they alleadged Scriptures as well as we:</hi> that we denie, for they alleadged them corruptly, to proue their hereſies, and would not be drawen to expound one Scripture by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but peeuiſhly vrged the literall or wrong ſence of ſome hard places, againſt the circumſtances both of the ſame places, and that which is manifeſtly taught in others: which is your faſhion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and we alleadge them truely to confirme onely the trueth, and therefore are very well contented, that our interpretations ſhould be tried by all ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and good rules of interpreting. Whereas you adde, <hi>If we ſay, they were heretiques, and abuſed the ſcriptures, &amp;c. the like report you ſay is of vs:</hi> I ſay, the more is their fault that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of vs, for they can neuer proue it. Howbeit to make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſeeme the more probable, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare our dealings with theirs, which (by your ſaying) are very like. But the reader muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, that you frame their ſpeeches &amp; doings here without booke: I meane, without warrant of any good authour that reporteth theſe things of them, euen of your owne head, that ſo you may the better make their ſpeeches and ours alike. I praie you, in what good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour did you euer reade (and yet here you confidently aduoutch it) that the <hi>Palagians, Nouatians, Neſtorians &amp;c.</hi> (who were long dead, and buried before your Pope was hatched) preached, <hi>that the Pope was Antichriſt?</hi> It may be true that you write, <hi>that ſome of them railed againſt the Roman Church, that then was.</hi> But, alas, what is this for your Romiſh Church now, which is no more like that then, then an apple is like an oiſter? Indeede this is one of your trickes, wherewith you cooſen the poore ſimple people. For it is the faſhion of you all, when you finde in any ancient father, anie thing that ſoundeth to the credit of the Catholique church, or to the commendation of the Roman Church in their daies, to alleadge it as ſpoken in the commendation of your Romiſh church now a <hi>1000.</hi> yeares after their death, whereas there is more difference betwixt yours and that, which they ſpeake of, in weighty &amp; materiall points of doctrine, and diſcipline, then in yeares. If your Romiſh Church
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18269:173"/> now would returne to the ſtate of the ancient church of Rome, and grow once like that, you and we ſhould ſoone agree. For that is the thing, that we will ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with you, that it is you in your railing vpon our churches, that according to the faſhion of theſe ancient he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques raile vpon the church of <hi>Rome</hi> that then was, rather, then we. For our churches are <hi>1000.</hi> times more like it indeed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yours as it is now. Nether are you able to produce your authours, to proue that theſe heretiques did at euery word alleadge ſcripture, or appeal onely thereunto. For the contrary is euident both in <hi>Epiphanius, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Auguſt:</hi> and others that wrote againſt them. For they teſtifie, that many of them ſhunned the triall of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely, and fled, euen as you doe, to traditions, ſucceſſion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, viſions, &amp; other ſuch like motiues, as councels, fathers, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, conſent &amp;c. as I haue ſhewed <hi>cap. 3.</hi> &amp; as appeareth euidently in diuers of theſe fathers writings, as in <hi>Tertul: in praeſcrip: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra haeret: Epiphanius</hi> in many places <hi>de haereſibus: Chryſoſt: in Math: 4. Irenaeus libro: 3. cap. 2. Auguſt: Contra Maxim: lib. 1. de Baptiſmo contra Donatiſt: lib. 3. cap. 2. in Ioan: Tract. 13. de vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Eccleſiae: cap. 15. Epiſt. 165. ad Generoſum.</hi> Who but one of your Religion would euer thus groſſely abuſe his ſimple poore Reader? You yet, as a man that had ſaied all this while nothing, but that you might truely ſay, proceede on with your compariſon, &amp; tell vs, <hi>that they were conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by generall Councels, &amp; ſo are we: they were found cogging knaues, and ſo ſhall we.</hi> Whereunto I anſwere, that thoſe which you call generall Councels, were but late Conuenticles of your owne, ſince the apoſtaſie of your Church from the ancient Roman Church, wherein there was indeede no freedome of a lawfull Councell enioyed, and therefore whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation we neede care no more for, then Chriſt and his Apoſtles needed to care for the ſentence of condemnation, that in their times the high Prieſtes, Scribes, and Phariſees gaue of them and their doings in their councels. And as for your vnmanerly prophecie, we neede not eſteeme it. For neither is your mouth any ſlander, nor yet doe we take you to be a true Prophet. <hi>But ſeeing</hi> (ſay you) <hi>they and you be thus like, why ſhould they be condemned for heretiques, &amp; you abſolued, &amp; receiued?</hi> I anſwere, the likelihood is denied, and the reaſon I haue giuen you alreadie. As for <hi>Auguſtines</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme you talke of, it is impertinent, and toucheth vs not. For we doe not with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhut vp Chriſts inheritance within the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18269:173"/> compaſſe of any place, as they did in <hi>Africke,</hi> neither ſay we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt at any time hath loſt his in heritance, but we ſay, that Chriſt hath had alwaies, and hath ſtill his Church without reſtraint of place, whereſoeuer it pleaſeth him: neither doeth it remaine now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a fewe rude Switzers, and in two or three corners beſides, as it pleaſeth you to ſpeake. For it is well ſeene, that diuerſe whole kingdomes, as <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke</hi> haue receiued our Religion, and that indeede it groweth ſo mightily in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it maketh the ſtouteſt of you greatly feare, that ere it be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, your kingdome of the Pope will be greater in the weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> then in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Hauing done with vrging this probleme (which indeede fitteth you Papiſts better, then vs, in that you tie Chriſtes inheritance to your Popes girdle) you tell your Reader (but you meane to proue it at leaſure) <hi>that theſe heretiques,</hi> that you haue talked on all this while, <hi>haue fortified their campe with as manie moe places, as wee alleadge:</hi> and therefore once againe you would haue a reaſon, <hi>why that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſhould bee counted heretiques, and not we?</hi> You make vs anſwere, <hi>becauſe they did interpret them contrarie to the Churches doctrine:</hi> which you ſuppoſe, is the onely anſwere we can giue. But I haue tolde you, that becauſe when there is queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of truth, there is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly alſo queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, our anſwere is, that their alleadging of them was hereticall, &amp; ours true and right, as may be proued by the ſcriptures themſelues, and by the right rules of interpreting of them. But be it, that we anſwere as you imagine, what haue we loſt, or you gained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? This ſay you, <hi>that you haue no more right, then they, to be counted Catholiques, becauſe you alleadge them alſo contrarie to the Churches doctrine.</hi> Here againe you deceiue both your ſelfe and your Reader, with the ambiguity of the word Church. For if wee anſwere, that we reiect their allegations, for that they alleadged them contrarie to the Churches doctrine that then was: we by the Church, vnderſtand a ſound and ſincere church of Chriſt in poſſeſſion of ſound Religion, and not whatſoeuer Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue will entitle it ſelfe with the name of the Church, and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Church warre againſt the true church. In which ſence onely your Church (againſt whoſe doctrine wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge them) hath the name of a church. And yet you, as though
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18269:174"/> it muſt needes be graunted you, that your church is aſwell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt, as that that was in their times, you make our fault and theirs one, becauſe we contrary yours, which is the church falſely ſo named: whereas they in theirs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traried the churches doctrine true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo tearmed. You muſt proue therefore your Church now, and that which was <hi>1000.</hi> yeares ago, at leaſt, to be al one in doctrine (which you can neuer doe) before you can proue their fault and ours to be all one. Howſoeuer this vſe yet, you will make of the variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the alleadging of the Scriptures by theſe heretiques, that you wil not remooue from your Religion, or faith (which falſely you call ancient) for all the ſhrill noiſe of our Goſpell. Whereunto this onely I reply, that if now (the diuerſity betwixt their dealing and ours herein ſhewed you, as it is) you that notwithſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this minde vpon this ground, you therein ſhall ſhew your ſelues to bee ledde rather by will, then witte, or any ſound wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt you giue ouer wandring any longer ſo farre abroad, for examples to this purpoſe, and you will talke (you ſay) but of the ſectes and heads of hereſies of this preſent time: who all likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge ſcripture, and condemne one another. And therefore, hauing reckoned vp <hi>Lutherans, Anabaptiſtes, Puritanes, Proteſtantes, Preciſians, Zwinglians, Caluiniſtes, Caeleſtes, Deiſtes, &amp; Trini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> you would knowe of vs, which of theſe you ſhould receiue. And to make your queſtion the harder to anſwere, you adde (ſaying) <hi>If we receiue ſome, and not all, they that are refuſed will thinke they haue wrong offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they haue as good ſtore of ſcripture well alleadged, as the reſt: and if all ſhould for this cauſe be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then thereupon would followe a Babylonicall confuſion.</hi> This obiection, taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the variety of ſects and opinions in theſe daies, I haue ſo anſwered in anſwering to your fourth chapter, that thereby I haue made it moſt cleare, that (though you had as great ground for it as you pretend) yet all that variety neither can nor ought to preiudice any thing our Religion. And therefore vnto that anſwere of mine hereunto, I muſt referre the reader both now and hereafter, whenſoeuer it commeth, for his ſatiſfaction: yet this here I would haue him further to note, that to make the number ſeeme the greater, you haue here reckoned vp them as different Sectes, &amp; heades of hereſies, amongſt whom either there is full agreement, as betwixt them, whom you call <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> or but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18269:174"/> ſuch difference, as notwithſtanding they agree in the ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, and fundamentall points of Religion, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> &amp; they whom you tearme <hi>Puritanes.</hi> Which differences if they be ſufficient with you to make different Sects, &amp; ſeuerall heades of hereſies, then as many ſeuerall orders as there be amongſt you of your religious men, and women, and as many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ſortes of ſchoolemen as you haue, differing amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in queſtions of diuinitie, ſo manie ſeuerall Sectes there are amongſt you: all which would riſe to a marueilous long beadrole. And indeede he that conſidereth well theſe thinges, though hee ſhall finde you like <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes tied togither by the tailes, with the thong of the Popes ſupremacie, yet otherwiſe hee ſhall and may moſt eaſily finde, that you are farre more iuſtly to bee charged, to nouriſh within your Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> multitudes of ſects, and heades of hereſies then we, both for that you exceede infinitly in number and matters, and for that whereas ſome of ours, to our griefe, vnwillingly are tearmed by our enimies <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Zwinglians, &amp;c.</hi> you delight and take pleaſure in your diſtinct titles of diuiſion, as to bee called <hi>Dominicans, Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſcans, Ieſuites &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, there are ſome of theſe, which you here name as <hi>Caeleſtes, Deiſtes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trinitaries,</hi> and <hi>the Sect of the family of loue</hi> (wherewith elswhere ſome of you charge vs) who are far liker you then vs, and haue rather ſprung vp amongſt you, and of you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs. And this is certaine, that all theſe, our men haue beene more painefull to detect, and confute them, then euer were yours. Our anſwere therefore to your demande hereupon builded, is this, though all theſe alleadge ſcripture, yet neither alleadge they it aſwell as we, neither is there any remedy, but that you muſt and ought to receaue them, for the true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Catholique church (howſoeuer others alleadge them) that alleadge them beſt &amp; ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt. But then, you will ſay, you are as farre of, as you were in the beginning, ſeeing euery one will ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon this, that he and his ſide alleadge them beſt, and therefore once againe you will reply &amp; ſay, that to determine who doeth beſt alleadge them, is a thing ſo harde, that fewe ſhall be able to finde it out: and therefore in the ende you ſhall be driuen to thinke it neceſſary, that the Pope ſhould be iudge in this caſe, otherwiſe men ſhall neuer be at a certainty whom to fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low. Hereunto I anſwere that the harder the matter is, the more paines men ought to take thereabout, ſeeing to know and finde the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18269:175"/> trueth, ſtandeth them ſo much vpon: ſecondly, I ſay with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that when you and all the world haue done what you can, <hi>there muſt be hereſies amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they which are approued amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be knowen. 1. Cor. 11.</hi> Thirdly, how hard ſoeuer it ſeeme, yet by ſearching of the ſcriptures, &amp; examining the allegations &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of them, by the rules of right interpreting (w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I before ſet downe) in humility of ſpirit, God will leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be his (how ſimple ſoeuer) at one time or other by the direction of his ſpirit, to finde out who they be, that ſoundlieſt ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle them. For he hath promiſed, <hi>If we ſeeke, we ſhall finde, and if we knocke it ſhal be opened vnto vs. Mat. 7.7.</hi> And as for the iudgement of the Pope, or any one certaine ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in his wiſedome foreſawe what was in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo how prone to erre: in this caſe he hath not appointed vs any ſuch to run vnto for the determining of this matter. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is intollerable preſumption for any ſuch to take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch iudges in this caſe, that they cannot erre. The miniſtry of men, conference with men, reading of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s labours vpon matters of Religion, &amp; ſuch other good helps, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an earneſt and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble inuocation of the name of God, for the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſpirit, are to be vſed carefully of euery man, as he may, in this caſe But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all commeth to all, we ſee no other, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the will &amp; pleaſure of our God, rather to leaue vs thus to be exerciſed in ſcearching the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; in trauelling by theſe meanes to finde out the truth, &amp; to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our ſelues therein, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſend vs for full reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any one man or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaſt ſo we ſhould after be deceiued through the errour of thoſe men, then we ſhall be this other way. Seeing therefore Chriſt tooke this way himſelfe, both with the deuil himſelfe, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his chaplaines, both to confute their errours &amp; erroneous interpretations, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the trueth, by ſearching the ſcriptures: and neither he nor his Apoſtles ſent vs either by word or their example, to the high Prieſts then, or vnto any other for reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church or trueth, this way as the beſt &amp; only way we thinke all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bound to take. And in ſo doing, let not any man deſpaire, but that through the goodnes of God, he ſhalbe inabled to trie the ſpirits, &amp; to diſcerne, who amongſt all other alleadge the ſcriptures ſoundlieſt. For we ſee it is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of our God, to reueile his trueth and the miſteries thereof, to thoſe that be his; how ſimple ſoeuer, when he doeth conceale &amp; hide them from the great men of the world. <hi>Mat. 11.1.

For it appeareth <hi>(Ioh. 17.)</hi> that Chriſt himſelfe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vnity amongſt his Apoſtles, and all that ſhould beleeue their doctrine; &amp; no doubt of it, he was heard in that he praied for. <hi>Heb. 5.7.</hi> and obteined, for his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father would deny him nothing: and yet you haue heard <hi>(cap 4.)</hi> after this there were varieties of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hoate contentions betwixt ſome of them, that doubtles of both parts were within the compaſſe of Chriſtes praier. And therefore that praier of Chriſt, and the prayers of his ſeruants made to that ende, are to be vnderſtoode to take place, and to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in that there is ſo much vnity amongſt the true members of the Church atteined thereby, as is ſufficient to holde them togither in the communion of ſaints: which is, if they ioyne togither in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the foundation, and fundamentall points of Religion, though otherwiſe there be differences and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it may not be thought (as you ſeeme to take it) that ſuch prayers either are not effectually made, or els there muſt followe thereupon ſimply an vniuerſall accorde in all things. For then Chriſtes prayer was not effectuall, in that after, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were at a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo much vnity there is betwixt vs, and thoſe whom we count members of Chriſtes Church with vs, as that, though there be ſome variety of opinions, and therefore alſo contention but too much, yet we ioyne ſo togither here in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and other moſt principal points of our Religion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we doubt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18269:176"/> not, but the Lord hath heard our praiers, and graunted vs the ſpirit of vnity ſo farre forth, as that one daie we hope in heauen all to ioine together in perfect vnity, notwithſtanding the iarres that otherwiſe in the meane time, to trie vs withall, be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amongſt vs. You know we praie daily, that Gods will may be done in earth, as it is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (and ſo doe you, or you are to blame) and herein we hope, we are heard: and yet ſimply we neuer found, nor ſhall, as long as the world ſtandeth, the will of God ſo done here, as it is in heauen. For conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually there is diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his will here in one thing or other, one way or other, euen amongſt the beſt, but in that, in ſuch meaſure, as God ſeeth this fit to be obteined here, he granteth it, we are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to thinke our prayers effectuall. Chriſt himſelfe praied <hi>(Iohn. 17.15)</hi> to deliuer his church from euill, and yet though that prayer was heard, in that God ſo farre forth preſerueth his church from euill; as he ſeeth it expedient for the ſtate thereof here, we ſee daily that many are the troubles, and euils that the poore church is encombred withall. And therefore (to conclude) you muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the faithfull praiers of Gods ſaints are to be accounted effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, though the thing they pray for, be not obteined in full perfection here, as long as ſo much here is obteined, as the Lorde ſeeth to bee neceſſary and conuenient for the eſtate of his ſeruantes. So that notwithſtanding the differences amongſt vs, you might and would (if you had the grace) ioyne rather with vs in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then continue in that wherein you are; the profeſſours whereof are torne a ſunder with moe and greater differences, then the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that receaue ours are: howſoeuer you deceiue the ſimple with the vizarde of vnity, in that you ioyne together vnder your Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the trueth.</p>

And therefore what vaine thing is it either for you, or any of your fellowes in this ſort ſtill to amplifie this one controuerſie about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament amongſt vs, as though it were ſufficient cauſe of all, or of any of theſe thinges, which you inferre thereupon againſt vs. Had there beene any wiſedome in them that liued in theſe ancient times, when theſe contentions were that I haue ſpoken of here and elſewhere, thereupon to haue gathered either all, or any of theſe thinges? Nay, it is euident, that if thereupon they had either ſtoode a loofe from the trueth, growen Neuters or Atheiſts, that they had beene without excuſe before God. For ſeeing to know the trueth, and to be ſettled in it, is a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as it is, the more difficult it is made by ſuch meanes to finde it out, the more thereby they that are the Lordes, and haue anie grace, are prouoked to labour, and ſearch to finde it, and to ſettle themſelues the ſtronglier in it. And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch offences haue beene, and alwaies in ſome meaſure are like to bee for the exerciſing of the Church, and triall of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you and ſuch as you, that by ſuch diſcourſes, as this, leade the people to gather ſuch leſſons thereupon, as to ſuſpende their iudgement till all partes be agreed, or now to bee caried this way, now that way, as long as the contention laſteth, ſeeme to be diſpoſed, to teach the people to learne how to bee Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtes. If you minded to haue them ſettled in Religion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued from neutralitie, the mother of Atheiſme, it were your partes to ioyne with vs (eſpecially in theſe great diuerſities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about Religion, that be now a daies in the world) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them moſt diligently to ſearch the Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to trie all ſpirits, and their opinions, whither they be of God or no: yea euen ſo much the more, for theſe varieties ſake, that ſo they might finde the trueth, and be ſettled in it. For they may not fainte, or giue ouer thus doing for this: for neceſſary it is that theſe ſhould come: theſe haue beene, and will be for the triall, who they be indeede, that thirſt after the trueth, and will cleaue vnto it. But in taking this contrary way, whatſoeuer you ſay, not wee, but you leade men, and that with a ſtrong hand to Atheiſme. And ſo much the more folly you ſhew, in making theſe collections of yours

Howbeit <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. the 4 Pope after, taketh <hi>Stephens</hi> part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Formoſus,</hi> and that ſo hoatly, as that once againe, though he were the ninth Pope from <hi>Formoſus,</hi> he cauſeth his body to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp out of his graue, diſgradeth him againe, beheadeth him, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the 3 fingers that were left him of his right hand, and threw his body, and the peeces thereof deſpitefully into <hi>Tyber.</hi> About the yeare 1354 (as <hi>Godfridus de Fontanis</hi> writeth) there grew and burſt out marueilous hoate contentions betwixt the Friers of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicke</hi> and <hi>Francis in Fraunce,</hi> about their priuiledges, and the prelates of <hi>France</hi> and the Schollers of <hi>Paris:</hi> inſomuch that there were publicke and bitter Sermons made by one againſt another, &amp; the one ſide excommunicated another. And <hi>Matth.

About the yeare 1470. there was a notorious
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18269:178"/> contention alſo betwixt the <hi>Dominicke</hi> friers, and the <hi>Minorites,</hi> the one ſide following <hi>Scotus,</hi> and the other <hi>Aquinas,</hi> whither <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was conceiued in originall ſinne or no: the <hi>Minorites,</hi> with <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> holding the negatiue; and the other, with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: which in the yeare 1509 grew ſo great, that it troubled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided al theſe Weſterne partes of the world, notwithſtanding that Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4, had giuen out his bull in the yeare 1576. on the <hi>Minorites</hi> ſide. Inſomuch that ſome of the <hi>Dominicke</hi> friers were burned at <hi>Berne,</hi> for their deuiſes to maintaine their faction, as witneſſeth both <hi>Pencer,</hi> and <hi>Munſter.</hi> And who knoweth not of the 24. great ſchiſmes (at leaſt) which haue bene in the Romiſh Church? during which times (ſome of them laſting verie long) their Church was torne into ſo many factions, as there were Popes and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popes. Amongſt which factions and their heads, there grewe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times warres indeed, and when they were quieteſt, railing proceſſes and excommunications one of them againſt the other in moſt bitter maner (as the ſtories of thoſe times doe teſtifie) were vſual amongſt them. But what ſhould I ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne any further into this matter? Seeing it is a thing moſt certaine, and whereof no man can be ignorant, that hath taken any paine in reading Stories, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for all her brag of vnitie, theſe late yeares hath beene ſo ful of hoate and fierie contentions, as that neuer a country, neuer an order, neuer a Cloiſter or Church amongſt them, but it hath had moſt tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous contentions, at one time or other, both within themſelues, and with others. And therefore, if this contention amongſt vs be cauſe ſufficient of ſuch concluſions, and dangerous conſequents, as you ſet downe in this chapter, what my all theſe bee, which we know haue bene amongſt you, and of like, whereunto we know, your Church is yet ful? And that more is, certain it is, that howſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently you write, that there haue bene excommunications betwixt the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> one againſt another about this matter (though with griefe we muſt confeſſe, that it may be, that both partes haue exceeded their bounds but to far) you make here a greater ſhew of it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is iuſt cauſe. For whatſoeuer certaine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (as you tearme them) haue done in excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the other, yet I thinke you can neuer proue, that <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any of his iudgement in this point, haue proceeded to far againſt any of them. But if they had, why ſhould this ſeeme ſo ſtraunge a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. For you know, I am ſure, that <hi>Victor</hi> once biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:18269:179"/> did excommunicate certaine biſhops in his time of the eaſt Church, becauſe they would not ioyne with him and the weſt Church in the time of obſeruing Eaſter. And that <hi>Stephanus</hi> another biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> went as far againſt <hi>Cyprian</hi> for his opinion of rebaptizing, you cannot be ignorant. Againe you know, that there are but few of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that purſue this controuerſie ſo hoately (the greater part being contented to deale in it more brotherly, and quietly) and that the hoateſt of them alſo haue beene ſo thorowly anſwered to all their obiections, as that there beginneth to be greater hope of vnity herein ere it be long, then you well like of, or then ſhal come to paſſe indeed if you can let it. But alas (though it hath bene far more, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the one ſide, then any waie can be iuſtified) yet what hath bene their bitternes and heat, of either ſide, at any time to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the bannings and curſings, fightings and brawlings, mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derings, manglings, and all barbarous extremities, that the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſpiteful heart of man can deuiſe, that haue beene amongſt your moſt holy fathers, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelues, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers &amp; followers at ſundry times, and for many yeares togither. Howſoeuer, as long as both parts agree in the fundamental pointes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other moſt neceſſary and fruitful docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning this ſacrament (as clearely appeareth by a booke lately ſet forth of the Harmony of our confeſſions) and the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie lieth onely about the maner of the reall preſence, and eating with the mouth, which mouth-eating (as all ſides confeſſe) may bee, and yet without fruit to the receiuer, the benefit indeed ariſing by his preſence onely to the faith of the communicant: the matter is not of ſo great moment, &amp; weight, as that either you ſhould neede to make ſuch a doe about, or that the maintainers therof ſhould neede to ſtriue ſo eagerly for. Which (I hope) God will in his good time reueale vnto them, and ſo make them to giue ouer their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to grow into vnity in this matter with their brethren. I cannot but tell you yet before I end this Chapter, that you verie greatly belie vs, when you write; that we haue giuen abſolute ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that the catholique Church hath erred euen from the Apoſtles times vnto this preſent, in praying to God for the ſoules of thoſe that are dead, conſtituted in a third place called <hi>Purgatorie.</hi> For both your deuyſes of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and of praying to God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of ſoules there, wee ſaie, and conſtantly defend to bee but popiſh deuiſes, founde out and grounded but vpon humane reaſon,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18269:179"/> dreames and fond viſions, and apparitions, and neither taught by the Apoſtles, nor any true paſtour of the Church of Chriſt, for three hundred yeares at leaſt after Chriſt. <hi>Tertullian</hi> was the firſt, and that in a booke writen by him when hee was a Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, that makes any mention towardes the allowance of prayer for the dead. And vntill the <hi>Florentine</hi> councell, the greeke Church could not be brought to ioine with you, in this doctrine of yours as you knowe well inough. And therefore it had beene more for your credit and honeſtie, to haue ſpared this your merrie conceit, and pleaſant deuiſe of wiſhing vs, though wee refuſe your <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> to prouide a thirde place for them, whom our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make conſtant on neither ſide. For either (if you had beene wiſe) you would haue vttered that your conceit with more trueth in your firſt entrance into it, or els you would haue let it alone for altogither.</p>

                  <p>WHat you haue gained by all you haue hitherto writen, to diſproue either our vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Religion (for all your great bragge here in the beginning of this Chapter) by weighing togither your obiections and my anſwers, now let the indifferent Reader iudge, vnto whom I doubt not (your bragge notwithſtanding) it ſhall and will well appeare, that both may be builded vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rocke, for any thing you haue yet ſaied. The onely new thing, that you ſet downe in this Chapter, is this, that the former variety amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that alleadge ſcripture conſidered, you allow well, that one ſhould liſten to meane men, alleadging ſcripture, though not very aptlie, to reforme maners withall. But when they are alleadged to teach faith, then it is meete, that the Catholique man truſt none, but the beſt, and thoſe alleadging them according to the general Councels; and all ancient doctours. And therefore you write, <hi>that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique muſt take heede of ſingular interpretations, that he muſt follow the ſentence helde &amp; taught by the ancient Catholique Church, &amp; not ſuffer himſelfe to be perſwaded from that faith, that all his ancetours did euer holde, the Catholique Church hath euer helde, the Scriptures, generall Councels, and all the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18269:180"/> ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctours doe teach. In which caſe, if one ſhould take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to be wiſer then all theſe, you would haue him</hi> (according to the prouerbe) <hi>accounted a foole, that thinketh himſelfe onely wiſe, and all others fooles, becauſe in reaſon it is more likely, that one ſhould erre, then al theſe &amp;c.</hi> Be it that al this were very true, what haue you woonne hereby againſt vs? For neither ſhall you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to proue (as we haue often tolde you) that your religion is that ancient Catholique religion, nor your Church to be the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent catholique Church, nor that your Church hath either the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, general councels, or fathers, as you herein take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, on your ſide. For in trueth you haue none of theſe on your ſides: but the onely grounds of your religion are your owne priuate and ſingular interpretations, &amp; traditions of men, without warrant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Scriptures indeed ſoundly vnderſtood, or from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, or ancient fathers, that are worthy to bee of credit in Gods Church. For (as we haue made appeare in infinite diſcourſes againſt you) al theſe are farre more ſtrong on our ſide, then with you. And therfore you rather are the fooles, that ſeeme wiſer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all theſe in your owne conceit, and ſo labour to draw vs from the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith and Chriſts true Church, by your corrupt gloſſes, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations of theſe, &amp; by your vaine &amp; vncertaine traditions of mortal men. Wherof let the reader take for a taſt theſe few proofes, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt infinite others vſed by vs. The Scripture with vs teacheth iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation freely by faith in Chriſt without workes: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.25. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.8.9. and you conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as heretiques, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teach ſo. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with vs teach, <hi>that Chriſts offering himſelfe once for al, hath made perfect all them that are ſanctified. Heb.</hi> 10.14. and you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily teach, that they muſt be perfected by the iteration of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in your maſſe, &amp; by a number of other things done by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and others for them. The Scriptures with vs teach, <hi>that Chriſt is aſcended into heauen, Coloſſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>that the heauens muſt containe him, vntill the reſtitution of al things, Act.</hi> 3.21. and you contrarily wil haue him, as oft as you conſecrate, to come downe, to hide himſelfe vnder the formes of bread and wine. The ſcriptures with vs ſay, concerning the cup in the Sacrament, to all Chriſtians rightly prepared, <hi>Drinke yee all of this, Matth.</hi> 26.22. and you ſay, it is hereſie to holde, that the lay people muſt drinke thereof. To proceed a little further, the ſame Scripture in the 2. Commandement <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4. forbiddeth (as we doe) both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18269:181"/> and worſhipping of Images, to repreſent God the father, the ſonne, or the holy Ghoſt withal; and you allow both theſe. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prefer (as we doe) <hi>the ſpeaking of fiue words in the Church that may bee vnderſtoode, before ten thouſand in a tongue not vnderſtoode:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.19. and your Church (as it appeareth in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all your ſeruice in lat in) preferreth fiue words ſpoken there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> an vnknowen tongue before ten thouſand, ſpoken in the vulgar tongue of the people to their edification. Laſtly, the Scriptures (as we doe) <hi>account mariage honourable among al men in al eſtates, and the mariage bed vndefiled: Heb.</hi> 13.4. inſomuch, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the forbidding of it (though vnder pretence of holines) <hi>to bee a doctrine of Deuils.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3. &amp; yet you condemne it in your prieſtes, as a filthie life. In like maner is there a plaine contrariety betwixt your religion, and the decrees of ancient and general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. In my anſwere to your 17. Chapter, I haue ſhewed you alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the ancient, famous, firſt general Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> in the 6. Canon thereof, is directly againſt that preheminence that now you giue to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ouer all Churches. There alſo you haue heard the councell of <hi>Gangra</hi> pronounce you accurſed, for your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine againſt the mariage of miniſters. I haue alſo ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the 6. generall councell holden at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the 36. Decree, hath flatly determined againſt the principall article of your religion, your Popes ſupremacy, in determining that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there ſhould haue equal priuiledges, with your Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The councels alſo of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> againſt your receiued opinion now, preferred the authority of a generall Councel before the authority of your Pope. And certaine it is, that in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, there was a councel called at <hi>Franckeforde,</hi> whereat the Biſhops of <hi>France, Germany</hi> &amp; <hi>Italie</hi> were aſſembled, about the year (as <hi>Regin</hi> writeth in his 2 booke) 794, where the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and worſhipping of Images, allowed of by the falſe Synode of the Greekes (as he tearmeth it) was condemned.

Whither the Scriptures giue teſtimony vnto our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18269:182"/> religion or no. I referre to the reader to iudge by that which I haue writen already, &amp; by that we haue writen from time to time in our bookes made in the defence of our religion. And concerning our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and calling, I truſt, I haue ſufficiently confirmed that, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, in that I haue ſhewed our calling to be conformable to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of true Paſtors in the Apoſtles time. But if further you require a more ſpeciall teſtimony from thence of our comming by our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ſende you now to 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it is prophecied, that God would towards the later end ſend his meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For neither was it prophecied, that the miniſters of Chriſt ſhould bring Antichriſt to conſumption, or the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> to her fall, by working of miracles, but (as you haue heard) by the ſpirit of Gods mouth, breathing in his euerlaſting goſpell: the force whereof, in our miniſtry, you perceiue daily to be ſuch, that it is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a miracle and wonder vnto you, to ſee in how ſhort time it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, and preuaileth ſtill againſt your kingdome, doe you what you can to let it: neither neede thoſe things ſo notably once confirmed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles (which are the onely things that wee teach) to be for your ſakes confirmed againe, though you be neuer ſo harde hearted. The word write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the miracles therin recorded already, muſt ſerue the turne, to conuert you to our religion therein taught, and thereby ſufficiently ratified, or elſe (gibe at it howſoeuer here) you ſhall one day, to your ſmart (I feare) find your ſelues to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all excuſe.</p>
                  <p>One tricke of your learning yet I maie not forget, which you haue in the beginning of this Chapter; which is this, that allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18269:183"/> this ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they that teſtifie of mee,</hi> you note, <hi>that he ſaied not, they are iudges, but they bearewitnes of me, which</hi> you tell vs, <hi>are two different things.</hi> This was by the way to giue vs a blow, that would haue no other Iudge, but the word of God. And to what end, would you haue the Scriptures, but to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at the barre, as witneſſes? Truely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your Pope, and your Church might ſit on the bench, as iudges, to giue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as it pleaſed them, whatſoeuer the witneſſes depoſe. But what little reaſon there is therein, nay, what blaſphemy that ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of, you &amp; euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may learne by the certaine &amp; infallible trueth alwaies witneſſed vnto vs by the one, &amp; of the manifold errors, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed by the other. It is worthy the marking, to ſee how ſtill it grieueth you, that the Scriptures, or certaine word of God ſhould ſit aboue your Popes &amp; you, to check &amp; controle your doings: and how faine you would bring them vnder, to bee iudged &amp; ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by you. But to anſwere this your obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you muſt be put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that there is not ſuch a difference betwixt a iudge, and a witnes, but one &amp; ſelfeſame man may be both a witnes &amp; a iudge: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if there be ſuch a force in this word witnes, here to driue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the barre to ſtand but amongſt witneſſes, there is as great, force in the word Iudge, in another place to bring them to the be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch againe, to ſit as iudge. Remember your ſelfe therfore, that the ſame Chriſt, that ſaied here, <hi>that the Scripture beare witnes of him,</hi> ſayed (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.48.) to ſuch as you are, <hi>He that refuſeth me &amp; receiueth not my words, hath one that iudgeth him, the word that I haue ſpoken ſhal iudge him at the laſt day.</hi> And neuer diſdaine you, that the ſcriptures, that bare witnes to Chriſt, ſit as iudges ouer you and your doings: if you doe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil not ſerue your turne. For Chriſt hath tolde you, what you ſhal truſt to, if you wil not ſtand to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, you ſhall one day (wil you, nil you) be iudged by them to your ſmart elſewhere. Wherefore howſoeuer in the end of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chap. you cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him a foole &amp; to be reiected, that counſelleth you to leaue that which you take to be the catholicke faith, confirmed by the ancient Doctors, &amp; general councels: if he bring ſcripture indeed on his ſide, you wil proue moſt foole, if you beleeue him not. This your <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaw, &amp; therfore he hath writen, <hi>that there is more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be giuen to one man learned in the Scriptures, and hauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>of his ſide, then either to the Popes ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or to the decrees of a general councel.</hi> And your <hi>Abbot Panormita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad Canone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18269:183"/> Titulo, de Electionibus</hi> hath the like ſaying. But indeed whiles we labour to draw you from your errors, to ioine with vs in our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we doe not perſwade you from that, but to that indeed, which our anceſtors, whom we may ſafely follow, the Patriarches, Prophets, Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles hath taught vs: and which the true Church of Chriſt hath by her ſound and faithful paſtors, &amp; lawful Synods, and councels euer ſince vnto this day taught vs. This wee are ſure is true.

And therfore I would wiſh you, for fear of the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this Iudge, the ſcriptures (though you labour neuer ſo much to bereaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that office of a Iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you) that neither lacke of miracles working by vs, nor the glorious dombe ſhewes of catholique faith, Catholique Church, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, and councels &amp;c. hold you any longer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioining hands with vs. For to pretend all theſe neuer ſo much, wil no more excuſe you from falling vnder the ſentence of this Iudge, then the like did your predeceſſors, the hie prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees in Chriſts time: who by reaſon of ſuch falſely pretended arguments, kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And therefore moſt willingly wee acknowledge (as Chriſt hath taught vs) <hi>that onely they are bleſſed martyrs, that ſuffer for righteouſnes ſake. Mat.</hi> 5. and none to be martyrs, howe patientlie ſoeuer they ſeeme to ſuffer their deathes, that by for an il cauſe, either in life or doctrine. And yet we are not ignorant, that many haue died in lewde, and for lewd opinions, who yet haue ſeemed to die willingly and cherefully: and therefore wee deny not, but that it may be true, that ſome ſuch wicked women of that beaſtlie hereſie of the Adamites, were put to death in <hi>Ziſchaes</hi> time, in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> &amp; died, as you write: and that it is poſſible, that ſuch filthy heretiques, as <hi>Seruetus</hi> was, may ſhewe themſelues ſtout in dying. But what is all this to proue, that our martyrs haue broken the vnion of the Catholique Church, or that they died as heretiques for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? Before you can ſay any thing to the purpoſe, either to proue them no true martyrs, or to blemiſh their patience, you ſhould haue proued, that their cauſe and religion, for which they died, was not the ſound Chriſtian trueth and faith: but that you wil neuer bee able to doe. And therefore both al this, and what els you haue noted (though falſely, for there is no ſuch thing, in either of theſe two places) out of <hi>Auguſtine contra Epiſtolam Petiliani,</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtes</hi> forwardneſſe to die, and out of <hi>Cyprians</hi> firſt booke of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, falleth downe to the ground as needles beſides the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For whatſoeuer they there ſpake, they ſpake it of heretickes, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath no force againſt vs, vntil you can proue vs ſo; in allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> teſtimony by the way of <hi>pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>theſis,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we know of what Church hee ſpake, when hee ſayed, the heretiques that hee wrote of, could not bee ſaued, becauſe they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues from the Church, the houſe of peace.</hi> Indeed wee knowe, that hee ment not your Church, which is a bloudie houſe, a houſe of warre, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: a houſe of error, &amp; ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the Church of Chriſt that was in his time, to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yours is not

At your pleaſure you call <hi>Michael Seruet, Caluins</hi> dearling, but you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proue, that he was euer in any ſuch accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Caluin,</hi> why you ſhould tearme him ſo. But yet if he had beene ſo, thorow his cunning in diſſembling his hereſie for a time, the more commendation was it to <hi>Caluin,</hi> that when he proued an obſtinate heretique, hee was ſo earneſt and zealous in the cauſe of his God, that all former affection ſet a part, he furthered his due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as he did. And for al your ſpeech, of his willingnes to die at <hi>Geneua,</hi> and great patience in dying, I cannot read, but that he ſhunned death there, as much as he could, keeping or holding ſtill his hereſie, and that thouſands haue died on the gallowes for murder, felonie, and treaſon, with as great ſhew of courage and patience, as he. But to let theſe things paſſe, and to returne againe to your principall drifte in this, which was (as you ſhewe in the beginning of it) to proue, that neither our vocation, nor religion could get any credit by the inuincible patience of our holy martyrs; what hath bene ſaied as yet to proue this? Your onely argument hitherto hath beene this, <hi>The cauſe, that a man dyeth for, muſt bee good: and hee muſt bee no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique: many heretiques haue dyed with great ſhew of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Ergo &amp;c.</hi> This argument is ſtarke naught: for al theſe things in your antecedent may be graunted, and yet of al them togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your concluſion followeth not. Theſe thinges which are not at al in queſtion you haue proued; but this that indeed ſhould haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life to your argument, that ours died in, and for an ill cauſe, &amp; were heretiques (which is indeede the thing onely in queſtion) like a wiſe man (becauſe you could not proue it) you let alone. But therfore you ſhall be contented (for al your miſerable crauing of it to bee granted you) to be denied both it and your concluſion, which, without it you can neuer come vnto. You will therefore proue (as you make your reader beleeue) that our Martyrs were ſuch, as died in an ill cauſe as heretiques, and therefore went to hel. But what be your proofes?
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18269:186"/> 
                     <hi>Ioachim Weſtphalus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> in a worke of his (but it ſeemeth either you could not, or would not tel vs in what worke, for ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique reaſon you had doubtles) mocked at <hi>Caluin,</hi> for vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting (but where he made this vaunt, or where we may finde it, you tel vs not) that within fiue yeares aboue an hundred had died for the religion of <hi>Geneua,</hi> prouing vnto him, that ſeeing there had beene far moe of the Anabaptiſtes put to death in leſſe ſpace, and that the Deuill had his Martyrs: his religion was no whit confirmed or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Martyrs: but they might for all his bragge, be in the vauntgard of the Deuils martyrs. What a miſerable argument is this? A contentious man in the heat of his contention ſaied thus to diſgrace his aduerſary and his ſide, therefore therupon it ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it was well and truely ſaied of him. I thinke you will gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> were good men both, yet in heat of contention one againſt another, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> burſt out into ſuch choler, as he ſaied, <hi>that he hoped the other ſhould neuer die biſhop:</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And therefore God forbid, that vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpeach of diſgrace vttered in ſuch a caſe by one againſt another, ſhould by and by a firme argument be gathered, that it is euen ſo, as the one hath ſaied of the other.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, you ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not ſo much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſpeach againſt <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins</hi> Martyrs, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, <hi>that there were mo of the Anabaptiſts, that had died in a ſhorter ſpace, then he talked of,</hi> and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>the deuil hath had his martyrs, which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon indeed it followeth, that an argument drawen to iuſtifie an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and the followers of it, from the bare death, and ſhew of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them that hold it, is not good: but ſo did neuer any of vs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For firſt we labour to proue, the cauſe good, and that done, then in the patience of ſuch, as haue died in ſo good cauſe, togither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cauſe, we take comfort. And yet in trueth, we are ſure, we may ſpeak it to the glory of God, there were neuer either ſo many, or any, that ſo patiently died for any other opinion, or opinions whatſoeuer, as firſt and laſt died for the teſtimony of our religion. For we account all them ours, that haue from the beginning died for the glorious cauſe of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and in that we are able by the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18269:186"/> Scriptures, to proue our religion to be the ſame, we are ſure, we are not deceiued in our account. In the concluſion of this Chapter, to ſhew your ſelfe to bee not onely one that dare write any thing how groſſe a lie ſoeuer it be, but as malitious in your iudgement, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any. Firſt, you ſet downe, not onely, that the Anabaptiſts condemne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that die in <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluins</hi> religion to hell (which is likely inough, becauſe they were franticke heretiques, &amp; haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the foundation) but alſo the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> will &amp; doe giue that iudgement one of another: and yet I am ſure, you are not able truely to ſay, that euer any of <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement ſaied, or wrote ſo. Secondly, though your owne iudgement be ſhort, yet ſo it is ſet downe, that you ſhew that you beleeue <hi>that all the three ſorts go thither?</hi> And ſuch care &amp; compaſſion your catholique heart had of it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you had done, that you ieſt at it, accounting your ſelues fooles, if you ſhould ſtay their paſſage thither.

                  <p>IN this Chapter you ſaie, that ſome of vs haue gone about to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that our vocation is of God, by the holines of life found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaied, <hi>The tree is knowen by his fruit: and the good tree bringeth forth good fruite. Mat.</hi> 7.17. Howſoeuer thus you would perſwade your reader, that wee are driuen to vſe theſe kinde of arguments, taken from the ſhew of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in our Martyrs, and the goodnes of the liues of the profeſſors of our religion, the trueth is, though ſometime the goodnes of their cauſe conſidered, we take comfort in their patience, and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that our religion hath wrought in many remembred, in ſome ſort we reioice therof alſo, yet neuer did we build the credit of our vocation or religion vpon either of theſe. For we know, there may be &amp; hath bene great ſhew of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in ſuch as haue died for hereſie: and that religion is not to be iudged either by the badnes or ſhew of goodnes in the liues of them that profeſſe it. For both amongſt the profeſſours of ſound Religion, we know there hath alwaies beene, are, and will be ſome lewd liuers: and alſo amongſt thoſe of a falſe Religion, thorow the force of hypocriſy and ſuperſtition, there hath beene found, and may be ſtill, a marueilous great outward ſhew of holines and piety. And therefore doe we alwaies teach our hearers, &amp; readers, to learne to diſcerne the true Religion from the falſe, by ſearching the Scriptures, and not by viewe of theſe thinges which therein may deceiue them. Wherefore you might very well haue eaſed both your reader, &amp; your ſelfe of all the paines you haue taken about this matter in theſe foure next Chapters. Howbeit, ſeing you could aforde ſo much needeles paines, to diſgrace what you could, the profeſſion of the trueth, I will bee contented to take ſo much paines, as to weigh what you haue ſaied, and giue you ſuch anſwere, as you deſerue, for the maintenance of the credit thereof. In this Chapter firſt you would proue, by conference of this foreſaied rule of Chriſt, with this ſaying <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Out of the abundance of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18269:189"/> heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> that it is no more generall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that. For after out of <hi>Math.</hi> 15. and other places you haue ſhewed, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſaying of Chriſt, man oftentimes ſpeaketh other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then it is in his heart: you conclude, euen ſo is it many times, naturally the fruite is good, when the tree is naught, as in the good liues of many heathen philoſophers: and contrarily, the trees may bee good, as grafte vpon the true Catholique Religion, and yet the fruites degenerate from the ſtocke. Be it graunted, that Chriſts meaning was no more generally to be taken in the one, then in the other, and that it followeth thereupon, that euen as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a man through hypocriſie may ſpeake well and thinke ill, ſo a good tree may ſometimes by ſome occaſion haue ſome fruite not anſwering the goodneſſe thereof, intermingled with the good, yet you ſhall neuer be able to proue, but that Chriſtes ſpeech here is ſo generallie true, as that alwaies a good tree bringeth forth good fruite, and a bad tree bad fruite: as alwaies it is true, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh at one time or other, though at ſometimes alſo and in ſome thinges the mouth be bridled. For Chriſt doeth not deny, but that euen of a good tree there may bee founde here and there a rotten apple, a worme-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one, or otherwiſe not anſwerable to the naturall fruite of that tree. For hee knewe, what imperfections there were, and would bee alwaies founde in the beſt men: neither doeth hee that ſaied, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> ſaie it would alwaies be ſo. For he knewe, how through hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie oftentimes the abundance of filthie matter lying in the heart would bee diſſembled. It is ſufficient for the verifying of theſe two Prouerbes generallie in that ſence, that Chriſt meant them, that the good tree naturally bringeth forth good fruit, and the bad, bad fruit: and that the abundance of the heart will make the mouth at ſometimes bewray that, which lieth in the heart, let otherwiſe hypocriſie doe what it can. And therefore you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude more, then your premiſes will beare. For though it bee graunted you, that the one prouerbe hath ſome limitations as well as the other, yet it muſt bee onelie in maner, as I haue ſaied. Whereupon will neuer more followe, that an ill tree may haue ſometimes naturallie good fruite growing vpon it, and a good tree, bad fruite: then it will euer be found falſe, that at one time or other <hi>out of the abundance of the heart euerie mouth
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18269:189"/> will ſpeake.</hi> And the examples, you haue ſet downe are both vnfitte. For neither were the workes of the heathen philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers (what ſhewe ſoeuer they had outwardly of goodnes) good workes indeede, nor euer will it be graunted you of any that can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt good and euill, that a Catholique in your ſence (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doubtles with you is one of the Popiſh Religion, that now is) is a good tree? The reaſon of the one is, becauſe howſoeuer the works of thoſe philoſophers had in them the matter of good workes, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity they had to the outward actions commanded by the law, yet they lacked the forme of good workes, in that they neither procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a right fountaine, were done to a right ende, nor in right maner: and you know, that <hi>forma dat eſſe rei:</hi> the forme is that, that cauſeth the thing to bee this or that: and that it is writen, <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, Romans.</hi> 14, <hi>and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God without faith: Heb.</hi> 11. which faith they were without. The reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other is, that your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being naught &amp; Antichriſtian it ſelfe, cannot make any man or woman a good tree, but bad like it ſelfe: for <hi>qualis cauſa, talis effectus:</hi> ſuch as the cauſe is, the effect will be. Wherefore for any thing you haue ſaied as yet, euery good tree will ſo bring forth good fruit, and euerie bad tree, bad fruit, as that by their fruit they maie bee diſcerned. And indeed (cauill you to the contrary as much as you liſt) this is moſt certaine: all the difficultie is in knowing the good and bad fruit that Chriſt meant of, and how alwaies to diſcerne the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In my iudgement (and I thinke likewiſe in the iudgement of euerie one, that well weigheth Chriſtes words and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof) by the good fruit wee are to vnderſtand pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ioined with an holie life: by the bad fruit, a bad religion, and like life: the good tree, that beareth the former, are onely the children of God, whom he hath regenerated, and iuſtified indeede in Chriſt Ieſus: the bad tree that beareth the later, are thoſe, that remaine in their ſinnes, and vnder the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, not yet hauing had their eies truely opened, to ſee the trueth, nor their hearts effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually touched, and taught to beleeue aright in Chriſt. And theſe trees are to be diſcerned by ſound triall and examination, which of their fruites are iuſtified by the write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vndoubted word of God, and which not.</p>

                  <p>PArtly in the former Chapter, but more plainly in this you ſhew, that you vnderſtand by the trees, that Chriſt ſpake of, good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and bad. But if you view the place, you will (at leaſt I am ſure, you ſhould) rather thereby vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſons of men effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called (as I haue ſaied) or not called at all, or (at leaſt) yet vnef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called: &amp; that ſound religion is one of the principall fruits, that he meant ſhould grow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, to diſcerne him from the later. For his ſcope was not there to teach vs, how to diſcerne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, but how to diſcerne the children of God from the children of ſathan. And thus it will proue, that the ſence of this prouerbe will not proue hard at all to vs to digeſt, but to you: who what ſhew ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the philoſophers of outward good works (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you brag luſtily in the later ende of this Chapter) yet you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to proue your ſelues good trees, becauſe your Religion by the ſound and perfect touchſtone of the ſcriptures, wilbe proued falſe, and Idolatrous. This your ſelfe giue to be the very reaſon, why the philoſophers were bad trees, notwithſtanding that in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of outward ſhew of holines, we may truely confeſſe with you, that euen their liues at the day of iudgement ſhall &amp; will confound a number of Chriſtians in name, which led Painims liues. And therefore vntill it be ſet out of queſtion, that your Religion is not falſe, nor Idolatrous (which is impoſſible, as long as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures keepe their place) if you bragge of ten times moe outward workes, then either you doe, or can, yet your owne mouth will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18269:191"/> you, as yet to haue ſaied nothing to proue your ſelues good trees. And on the contrary euen by this your owne ſaying, if we can proue our religion to be the ſound Chriſtian faith, taught indeede by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and therefore that neuer ſince, hell gates could preuaile againſt it (which we doubt not of, whenſoeuer you will enter into this controuerſie with vs) then (for all your ſaying here to the contrary) Chriſtes ſentence ſhall giue vs very good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing ſhewed your cunning in reſtraining, and collecting of this prouerbe of Chriſt, as I haue: now as one, that after ſome wreſting, found it ſtronger for you, then you would haue thought, you graunt it to be moſt true, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naturallie a good tree bringeth forth good fruit, &amp; not bad at all, and a crab-tree nothing but crabs. And this you labour to proue, firſt, by certaine teſtimonies of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, <hi>that he that is borne of God, ſinneth not,</hi> &amp; then by other places, as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. <hi>Sap.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. you confirme that doctrine of <hi>S.

                     </gap>il tree, as the philoſophers, may bring forth good fruit: &amp; a good tree, as a Catholique in Religion (by whom you meane a Papiſt) may bring forth ill fruits: and (will you, nill you) you are enforced to confeſſe, that Chriſtes wordes are generally true, &amp; ſimply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alwaies verified of both good trees, and bad trees, as they are naturally conſidered. But yet you adde, the tree is knowen by his fruit, and faith by workes, ſo as then the fruit bee ripe in due ſeaſon, &amp; not otherwiſe. Wherein I take your meaning to be, that not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhew of fruites, nor vnripe works, but works indeede good both in matter, and maner of doing, are the fruits, whereby a good tree, &amp; iuſtifying faith is diſcerned. You yet proceede and ſay, that, as a rotten and wormeaten apple hanging vpon a good tree (ſeeing that came not thorow the nature of the tree, but by meanes of wormes, birdes, or ſome other ſuch accident) miniſtreth not a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to proue that tree to be an ill tree: ſo the ill workes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought not to ſtaine their holy Catholique religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18269:192"/> of their fruits, commeth not from the nature of theſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which forbiddeth ſuch fruits or workes, but from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. In all this (vnderſtanding not as you doe, but as you ſhould, the holie Catholique Religion indeede, which yours will neuer proue) we ioyne with you, and allow, what you haue ſaied. And as you ſuppoſing your religion to be the holy Catholique reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, haue thus anſwered the obiection, drawen from the good workes of profeſſours of our religion, and from the bad workes of yours: ſo euen in the ſame words and maner, ſuppoſing our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not yours, to be that true &amp; holy religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your obiection againſt vs, grounded vpon the good workes of ſome of yours, &amp; lewde liues of ſome that yet profeſſe ours, is alſo anſwered. For we tel you (as you ſeeme here to tel vs) that your works are not ripe works, ſuch as good works ſhould be, both in matter and maner, and therefore no argument more of the goodnes of your religion, then the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers works were of the goodnes of theirs: &amp; that the ill works fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſome of our profeſſours, ought not to ſteine our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, foraſmuch as none of them are iuſtified, but condemned by the ſame. But in the vttering of theſe things you haue vttered diuers things, whereof it is needful to admoniſh both you, and your Reader. Firſt, in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>S. Iohns</hi> words, you ſeeme ſimply to vnderſtand, that by being borne of God, hee meant nothing elſe but being baptized, as though they were both one, or (at leaſt) ſo inſeparably co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioined, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whoſoeuer were outwardly baptized, were certainely forthwith thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly regenerated and new borne, wherein, you and al that ioyne with you therein, ſhew both great errour and ignorance, in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of that ſacrament. For though by that ſacrament, al that haue receiued it, are ſacramentally new borne, and receiued into Chriſts Church, and therein haue had the waſhing away of their ſinnes, in the bloud of Chriſt, repreſented vnto them, offered vnto them, and ſealed and ratified, on Gods behalfe to belong vnto them, if they inwardly alſo will imbrace it: yet, to confound the ſacrament of regeneration and the waſhing away of our ſinnes, with regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remiſsion of ſinnes it ſelfe, or to tye the later, ſo vnto the former, as that of neceſſity, whoſoeuer is partaker of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is alſo partaker of the later, is againſt all good diuinity, Scripture, and experience. For diuinity admitteth not, a confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the outward ſigne with the inward grace in a ſacrament; &amp; the ſcripture, &amp; experience withall teacheth vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus</hi> was
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18269:192"/> baptiſed; and yet no ſounde diuine euer helde, that forthwith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was inwardly regenerated, for by his fruites, the contrary by and by euidently appeared, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. Againe, if outwardly to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were by &amp; by to be regenerated, then al that haue beene baptiſed haue beene inwardly regenerated, &amp; all that are baptiſed once muſt needs be ſo: which thing if it were ſo, why, &amp; how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe, that many neuer ſhew any fruites of regeneration, and die giuing plaine euidence, that they were neuer borne anew, notwithſtanding they were baptiſed; and that there is no more haſt made, to baptiſe <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and whomſoeuer we can come by? But it ſeemeth that as you holde this errour of baptiſme, that to defend it withall, you are of opinion, that a man once may be truely regenerated, and ſo the childe of God, iuſtified and ſanctified in the bloud of Chriſt, through grace, and yet afterwardes in concluſion finally may ſo fall awaie, that he become the childe of the Deuill, and this is the ſecond thing that I though good to admoniſh you, and your reader of. For this is alſo a moſt dangerous errour, ſhaking al the certaine grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of our faith, and therefore to our comforte it is plainely taught vs contrarie to this in the Scripture, that the gifts and graces of God (whereby are meant the giftes of regeneration) are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. and therefore whom Chriſt loueth once as his owne (as doubtleſſe he doeth all them that are new borne once indeede) <hi>Iohn</hi> tels vs he loues to the ende, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.1. And <hi>Paul</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this ground (that he knew with whom God once went ſo farre, as towardes them, to ſhew his power, and mercy in regenerating of them, that he would neuer finallie forſake them, but perfect in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that good worke of his) aſſures the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that he that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne that good worke in them, would performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.6. And yet I doe not deny, but ſuch maie haue their falles, and that in ſuch ſort, that to their owne ſence &amp; feeling, and in the opinions of others, they haue quite fallen from grace, and all the good gifts of regeneration; but yet if before they were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally onely, but really in trueth new borne, and clenſed from their ſinnes in Chriſt; the ſpirit and graces of God in them were but in this caſe, as the ſunne hid from our eies by thicke cloudes, and as fire raked vp in the aſhes, which God will cauſe to ſhine againe, and to growe to a fire in them, when hee in his good time hath cauſed the cloudes to vaniſh, and hath remooued the aſhes. This you can holde to bee true in <hi>Peter,</hi> notwithſtanding his fall, becauſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18269:193"/> Chriſt praied that his faith ſhould not faile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. why ſhould you not then vpon Chriſtes praier, made generally for all his elect, that his heauenly father would keepe them, and that from euill, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.15. conceiue the like of all thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath once ſealed indeede, with the peculiar ſeale of regeneration, proper onely to his elect? But it ſeemes you thinke you haue ground enough for this your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, in that you ſee many that haue ſeemed to ſtand, finally to fal; and that you finde the promiſſes run vpon this condition, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere vnto the end; whereunto I anſwere, that in the former, you may be deceiued two waies; either in taking them to haue ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, which yet neuer came vnto it, or in conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning them as finally to haue fallen, when as it may be otherwiſe: and as for the ſecond, I ſay, that as it is certaine, that the promiſſes runne vpon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo the Lord will giue all thoſe grace, to performe that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that be once thus ſealed to be his. <hi>For nothing ſhal ſeparate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; ſuch are kept by the power of god through faith vnto ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 1.5. You muſt therefore thirdly be admoniſhed, that indeede you doe miſunderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; the other teſtimonies to fortifie <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrin, as da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſly as euer did <hi>Iouinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Nouatus,</hi> or any other, if you take them ſo to be vnderſtoode, as it ſeemeth you doe, that by theſe places wee are taught, that none in any actuall ſinne, and hauing a minde to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is in that meane while, the childe of God, but of the Deuill. If this were true doctrine, ſeeing it is writen, that <hi>no man liueth &amp; ſinneth not,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>no man can ſay his hart is cleane, Pro.</hi> 20. but euen when we are at the beſt, we muſt needs confeſſe, <hi>that thoſe good things that we would do, we do not, &amp; thoſe euil thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs that we would leaue vndone, we doe, Ro.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; that if we ſay we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues, &amp; there is no truth in vs,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. &amp; therfore it is certaine that ther was neuer child of God yet, but ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times he hath had a mind to doe euill, and bene ſometime in actuall ſinne: I ſay, theſe thinges being moſt true, becauſe both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience teach them ſo to be, if this doctrine of yours be true alſo, then ſo often as there is a purpoſe, and performance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actuall ſinne, and as long as that is found in man, ſo often, and ſo long he is the childe of the Deuill, and not of God. If this be thus, if you knewe how farre actuall ſinne ſtreatcheth, and weighed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſembling, how prone the beſt men are to fall, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there is none of you all, that a whole day togither, can haue
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18269:193"/> aſſurance, that you are any other, but the children of the Deuill. For if the Lorde ſhould ſtraitely marke what is done amiſſe, and enter into iudgement with his ſeruants, no man could for one daies ſpace in trueth cleare himſelfe, of all actuall ſinne, committed either in word, deede or thought, by omitting good things commanded, or doing ill things forbidden. If in ſtead of ſaying, in the meane while, you had only ſaied, therein, and in that reſpect he is not the childe of God; your ſpeech might haue beene borne withall.

But to paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe pointes, which I thought good thus to admoniſh the reader and your ſelfe of, let vs returne to your concluſion of this Chapter, wherein, after you haue ſhewed vs, that to finde your Religion to be a good tree, we muſt not looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your rotten fruit, becauſe your Religion condemneth ſuch fruit, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your doctours and great perſonages that haue died throughout the world, in your faith, and left notable monuments of hoſpitalls, colledges, and ſuch like works behinde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; you charge vs not onely that our Religion cannot ſhew the like, but that rather wee haue ſpoiled and defaced your monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as your Abbies and ſuch like, and thinke to make ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with giuing ſome little now to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore. Whereunto briefly my anſwere is, this; all this cannot proue your Religion good, nor ours bad, vnles you can proue yours true by the ſcriptures, and ours falſe. For as bad fruits as theſe you charge vs withall may be founde, in them, whoſe Religion is good, &amp; as good as theſe you bragge of, to the outward ſhew, may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, where the Religion is falſe, and idolatrous euen by your owne doctrine, in the former Chapter, which anſwere were ſufficient. Howbeit, for the more full, and particular ſatiſfying of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reader, I ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, firſt in that you forbid vs to iudge of your Religion, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> view of the rotten fruit, that we haue found in ſome that haue profeſſed it, becauſe your Religion condemus ſuch fruit, you muſt not thinke much if we preſcribe the ſame rule to you, in reſpect of ours: for as euident it is that our Religion conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth ſinne, yea euen to the leaſt ſinne, as euer did yours, and more too, in that we condemne the firſt motions ariſing in mans minde to ſinne, though not conſented vnto, to be ſinne, which you deny; and in that we teach the leaſt breach of the law, deſerueth in it ſelfe damnation, and you doe teach there are a number veniall ſinnes, euen for the littlenes thereof, and therefore to be put away euen with trifling toies, and deuiſes of your owne. Secondly, I ſay that by that, your Religion be conferred with the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that moſt of theſe great perſonages, and doctors you talke of died in, and both of them be tried by the ſcriptures, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ours, it wil be founde, that not halfe of them died in your faith as you imagine, yea, that the ancienteſt and beſt of them died in ours, and therefore both they, and their monuments are ours, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18269:195"/> giue greater credit vnto our religion, then all the reſt doe vnto yours. And euen of late daies, diuerſe famous perſons of our religion, haue founded Schooles, Hoſpitals and Colledges, as well as yours. What Duke <hi>Caſsimer</hi> is, you know, and what hee hath done at <hi>Newſtade</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Germanie</hi> this way, it cannot bee vnknowen. Euen now alſo with vs in <hi>England,</hi> a zealous profeſſour of our Religion, and an ancient noble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, Sir <hi>Walter Mildemay,</hi> hath founded a noble new Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> called Emanuel Colledge. And ſince the beginning of her Maieſties raigne that now is, our gracious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Ladie Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> notable things by her ſelfe and others, there hath beene done, to the erecting of Hoſpitals and common Schooles, and alſo to the maintenance, and furtherance of learning, in both the Vniuerſities; inſomuch, that I dare bee bolde to ſay, it is as much to the good of this Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, as if an other ſuch Vniuerſity as one of theſe, had beene now founded, built, and endued as richly, as either of theſe now is. And though our Cleargy men now, be not able to builde ſo many Colledges as yours were, yet thoſe things that they doe that way, though they match not yours in quantity, they yet may ouermatch yours quickely in quality. For you know in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the widowes two mites, which ſhe threw into the treaſury, for the poore, of the little that ſhee had wel gotten, was in Chriſts account, a greater almes then theirs, which threw in farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſummes of their ſuperfluities. <hi>Marke</hi> 12. And well knowen it is, that the richeſt and greateſt of ours, are for their places, but beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to them, that haue beene of like, or the ſame place amongſt you, whereof, the reaſon is, not onely that they lacke a number of deuiſes that yours had, to encreaſe their gaine, but alſo, that they haue not your Romiſh conſciences, which with your Popes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, could make them wide enough to ſwallow vp the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, not onely of as many benefices, but alſo Biſhopricks and other offices, ciuill or eccleſiaſticall, as they could poſſibly get. Whereof it came, that of their very ſuperfluities, vnleſſe they had beene prouder then Lucifer, and more waſtfull in belly cheare, then euer was the rich glutton, ſome thing might well be ſpared, and of a number of them, ſo much, as might haue procured the building of many moe then they left behinde them. Hoſpitals and Colledges, though you would ſo inſinuate, we haue pulled downe none, but haue
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18269:195"/> increaſed the number of them. And as for your Abbies, &amp; other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things conſidered, this rather may be counted a good worke in vs, thus to haue defaced them, and conuerted their vſe, then a fault whereof wee need repent vs: And conſequently vaine is your charging of vs, with ſeeking to make amends with giuing a trifle to the poore.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18269:198"/> contrary to the trueth, both of the ſtory, and euidence of the thing. And howſoeuer the trueth were, concerning the death of thoſe ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> magiſtrates that you ſpeake of, certaine it is, that your ſaied author telleth of certaine men (he was aſhamed belike to name how many) by the magiſtrates of <hi>Prage,</hi> before that, ſecretly and treacherouſly murdered, in their councel-houſe, not concealing, that they that were ſo priuily made away, were fauourers of the religion of <hi>Hus,</hi> and that they that ſo diſpatched them were of yours, <hi>cap.</hi> 35. and 37: whereupon he ſaieth, that that matter comming to light, there was great ſturre in the Citty: wherupon, for that and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable iniuries before that offered them (not concealed by your owne authour, <hi>cap.</hi> 36.) it may be that ſome ſuch outrage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge thereof, was committed by ſome of their frends and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, as you note out of him. Which I rather beleeue, was or might be ſo, becauſe I reade in an other Hiſtoriographer, that in <hi>Ziſcha</hi> his time, the Conſuls of <hi>Prage</hi> beeing grieued with the ſturs that then were, called for <hi>Iohannes Premonſtratenſis,</hi> and nine of his adherents into their councel-houſe (as though they would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with them of the common wealth) and when ſo they had got them thither, that there they ſecretly ſlue them, which after being perceiued by ſome bloud, noted to haue come from thence into the chanels, that authour denieth not, but that thereupon there grewe ſuch ſtur and tumult, that the people ouerthrew the Councel-houſe and diuerſe other houſes, and ſlue eleuen principall Citizens, whom they iudged the authours thereof. Whereby yet any man may ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your ſide gaue the firſt example thereof, and that they therefore are as iuſtly to be blamed as the other. But what maruell is it to heare, that ſuch outrages fell out in ſuch turbulent times, eſpecially when they that in reſpect of their place, ſhould haue giuen example onely of iuſt and orderly dealing, behaued them ſelues ſo tyrannically and wickedly as they then there, of your faction, did? when euer hath it beene otherwiſe in ſuch times, and vpon ſuch occaſions, but that ſome things haue fallen out of both ſides not iuſtifiable. Indeede I graunt it had beene farre better, that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome peaceabler courſe, and lamentable it was of both ſides that there was ſuch ſhedding of bloud, but yet when men are prouoked as they were, and can conceiue no hope of better, but rather of worſe, ſuch is the infirmity of man, that we ſee, it commonly falles out ſo. As for your ciuill warres, and the miſchiefs that thereupon haue fallen
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18269:198"/> out in <hi>France,</hi> you muſt meet with a very meane man, and ſimple reader, if notwithſtanding the freſh remembrance thereof, and the ſtories therof writen, you can make him beleeue, that the fault ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is wholy ours. Nay euery man ſeeth, and vnderſtandeth that your ſide are they that beganne firſt thoſe troubles, that haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and with ſword moſt monſtrouſly conſumed, whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, men, women, and children, aſſembled to exerciſe themſelues, in praier, and hearing of the word, according as by your kings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, they were permitted; &amp; that your ſide it was, that vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an honourable mariage, betwixt the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and the kinges ſiſter, drew into <hi>Paris</hi> all the proteſtants of name, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as many as you could, and when you had them there, moſt tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and trecherouſly made a moſt bloudy maſſacre of them. And your friers or frends they were, that of late moſt villanouſly ſlew the <hi>French</hi> king. And the principals and acceſſaries to that moſt treaſonable murder, are they that yet are vp in armes againſt his lawfull ſucceſſor the king of <hi>Nauar.</hi> This and a number of ſuch other dealings of yours, are ſo famouſlie knowen abroad, that you come to late to buzze theſe things in the eares of men, that the ruins and deſolation of that kingdome is to be imputed vnto vs, or that wee haue beene the men that are worſe then the <hi>Goathes,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> in murdering thoſe, that we found in your Temples. A poore ſimple man perhaps that reades theſe things in your booke, will thereupon gather that you of your ſide, are men that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee charged with any diſorderly inſurrections, and rebellions, and that your ſide altogither abhorreth cruelty and neuer practiſed any, For who would thinke that of all other, you would bee ſo ready, ſo eſpecially, and vehemently to charge vs with theſe things, vnleſſe you were the cleareſt men in the world in them? But vnderſtand Chriſtian reader, that this is but their policy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thee, for there were neuer men more iuſtlie and deepely to bee charged with theſe thinges, then theſe men are. For if wee looke but into the ſtories of our owne countrey, wee ſhall finde that ſcarce one king hath paſſed his raigne without rebellion, for a long time togither, and that chiefely by meanes of the Popes curſing and banning them for money matters. This, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond, king <hi>Iohn, Henrie</hi> the third, <hi>Edwarde</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, ſixt, ſeuenth, and eight, and of late time, the ſtories of <hi>Edwarde</hi> the ſixt,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18269:199"/> and of her Maieſtie that now is, <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> doe make moſt cleare. For in all thoſe Princes tymes, wee reade of great troubles, and ciuill warres in this land, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies eſpeciallie ſtirred vp by the Popes, and their fauourers, if they had not what they would. Sure I am they will not, nor can ſaie, that they that were the authours and doers herein, were of our Religion, but of theirs. The like may bee ſaied of other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſince the time that their Religion hath floriſhed moſt. And certaine it is that none were euer in theſe parts of the world, ſince they came to their height, greater troublers of Chriſtendome, then their Popes themſelues. For in <hi>Italie</hi> vnder the names of <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> in <hi>Cicilie, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> for titles of thoſe kingdomes, and in <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>France</hi> for the tranſlating this way and that way the Empire, they haue beene the cauſe of moſt long and bloudy warres. And to paſſe ouer all the moſt ſauage partes, played by theſe men, (that would ſeeme to haue their hands, ſo free from bloudſhed, eſpeciallie in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) of late yeares in <hi>France</hi> in killing and murdering of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes, as couragiouſlie in Churches, as in any other places, where either by force, or ſubtlety they could ſurpriſe them: let them call to their remembrance what was done by a famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of theirs, <hi>Minerius,</hi> of late vnder pretence of a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Frauncis,</hi> the king of <hi>France,</hi> to the poore Chriſtians of <hi>Merindoll,</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> and the townes thereabout, and I thinke they ſhall bee inforced to confeſſe, that they are not the men, they would ſeeme to bee. For in that ſtory it appeareth, that after they had by a decree, in the high court of <hi>Prouince,</hi> for the not appearance of ten men of <hi>Merindoll,</hi> adiudged that towne, houſes, and trees to be made euen with the ground, and all the inhabitants thereof, men, women, and children, to bee conſumed with the fire, and that after their prelates and great men, had long laboured in vaine to put this decree in execution: that in the ende, this <hi>Minerius,</hi> being preſident in <hi>Prouince,</hi> handled the matter ſo, by falſe informing of the king, that he obtained a moſt bloudy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from <hi>Frauncis</hi> then king of <hi>France,</hi> through the helpe of the Cardinal of <hi>Turnon,</hi> to execute that arreſt. Wherein, though his commiſſion ſtretched onely to <hi>Merindoll,</hi> hee behaued himſelfe ſo, with the aſſiſtance that quicklie he got, that in ſhort ſpace he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroied <hi>Merindol, Cabriers,</hi> and other townes and villages,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18269:199"/> thereabouts, to the number of 22, giuing commiſſion to his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to ſpoyle, ranſacke, burne, and to deſtroy altogither, and to kill ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, woman, and childe, without al mercy, ſparing none: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they executed, in the cruelleſt maner, that their filthy and bloudy hearts could deuiſe, rauiſhing both women and maidens, and putting them to all the torments, they could imagine, cutting of the paps of ſome, ripping open the bellies of other ſome, and ſo moſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannouſly murdering al they could get. At <hi>Cabriers,</hi> thirty men he cauſed to bee hewen in pieces, in a medow neare the towne, and there he tooke .40. women, and cauſed them to be put into a barne ful of hey, and ſtraw, and ſo there to be kept in with pikes, whiles they &amp; the barne and all were burned: and there alſo he ſent a Captaine of his <hi>Iohn de Gay,</hi> to go with a company of ruffians to the Church; where were a great number of women &amp; young children, &amp; to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them all, which he did, ſparing neither young nor olde, and ſo one way and other, eight thouſand, were ſlaine in that towne. And but for to much troubling of the reader, a number as tragicall ſtories as this, might bee ſet downe of their dealings againſt the poore ſeruants of God, in diuers and ſundry other places, and namelie alſo not long after theſe thinges were done, in the countrey of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and thereabout: but euen this is ſufficient to make any man ſee, eſpeciallie this ſtorie beeing ſo famous, and done of ſo late yeares that your forehead muſt needs be growen very hard, yet to obiect ſuch things to vs, whereof you your ſelues haue beene moſt notoriouſlie guiltie. You haue tolde vs before, that wee muſt not ſeeke to blemiſh your Religion with the bad fruites wee finde vpon you, for your Religion condemneth them: which might iuſtlie haue ſtayed you from going about to ſtaine our Religion, with theſe things, eſpecially. For ſure I am that our Religion condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forbiddeth ſubiects to impeach their Princes ſafety, &amp; dignity, either by word or deede, &amp; deteſteth al kinde of ſuch barborous cruelty, and tiranny. Wheras it may bee iuſtly doubted, that howſoeuer your Religion, condemne ſome other groſſe faults, that be common in men of your ſide, yet it liketh well of theſe, and ſuch like kinde of dealings, becauſe it is a common thing, for your great Prelates to be the chiefe furtherers thereof, and to haue ſuch things, attempted vnder commiſſion from your catholicke kings, &amp; your Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore, though that your rule weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea fully anſwere this obiection of yours, againſt vs (though

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:18269:203"/> reader may ſee by that which I haue writen, that this is not our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwere, and that we anſwering thus, if you ſhould ſay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he now knoweth, that it is you and no other, that therein ſhould ſpeake contrary to the trueth. Indeed we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that we ſhould not learne of you, nor of any other, cruelly to ſeeke to reuenge our ſelues, for the Lord hath forbid vs to reuenge our ſelues, for <hi>vengeance is his, and he wil doe vengeance. Rom.</hi> 12.19. And if any of our ſide, haue tranſgreſſed this rule, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it not in them; neither do we incourage other to follow any ſuch exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but yet withal we tel you, and you know it to be moſt true, that ſuch may be the oppreſſion of Gods ſeruants, and the tiranny of their enemies, towards them, that he may as he hath done, extraordinarily ſtir vp ſome amongſt them, to reuenge their quarrels, and to deliuer them out of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, though ſuch extraordinary examples, are not to bee drawen into ordinary imitation. And though there bee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why wee ſhould learne to doe ill of you, of whom we account ſo euill; yet there is reaſon why you thinking ſo well of your ſelues, as you doe, ſhould not teach vs, by your often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to doe that, which if we doe but once, you count an heinous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in vs. You would haue the beſt to reforme the reſt, if your requeſt were graunted, you muſt amend apace, or elſe there will none of you be found in that degree. You are angrie with vs for ſpeaking as wee vſe to doe againſt your Popes, and biſhops, and for that in the mean time, we giue our ſelues glorious titles of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Euangeliſts, Prophets &amp;c, paſſing ouer the faults of our owne. Whereunto moſt truely I may anſwere, that ſo infinite and monſtrous haue beene the ſinnes and abhominations, of theſe your Popes and other prelates, for this long time, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for vs all, euer ſufficiently to paint out the filthineſſe of them: and as for our paſſing ouer in the meane time, the faultes of our owne (though indeede we neuer deny but that there are faultes amongſt our owne, for they are men, and indeed for all your ſaying, we are the firſt cenſurers of our ſelues oftentimes for thoſe faults) what reaſon is there that you ſhould require at our handes, that we ſhould neuer tell you of your faults, but that we muſt withal lay open our owne? When this is your faſhion, we will learne to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate you: and concerning titles which you ſay, we ſo gloriouſly ſet out our miniſters withall, they are yet but titles, by Chriſt in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word, left vnto his Church, and of them, ſome we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, were
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18269:203"/> extraordinary, and but for a time, as Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, of whom onely we glory in this, that our doctrine is the ſame y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they left vs in writing, &amp; the other titles of biſhops, paſtors, &amp; doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as fit for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, we take vnto vs, &amp; therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are we content. So that you rather haue aduaunced your Clergie with glorious and vaine titles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we, in that of your own heads, not thinking the titles that Chriſt hath left vs glorious inough, you haue your Popes, Cardinals, and diuers other ſuch ſtrange and ſwelling names of pride and vanity. Yet it grieueth you, as it ſeemeth moſt, that ſome of vs, now and then tearme your Popes and biſhoppes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening &amp; deuouring wolues; ſome labour therfore you beſtow in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying a ſimilitude to proue them no wolues: but hirelings and bad ſhepheards, that many of them haue beene a great while, yea &amp; that their ſinnes haue bene the cauſe of our proſpering and preuailing as we haue, you will not deny vs. It is wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the euidence of the trueth, and the force thereof, hath preuailed thus far with you, to cauſe you to graunt vs thus much: I feare me if a number of your Prelates, and Popes ſhould come to the reading of this, you ſhould haue ſmal thanke of them, for yeelding thus farre. Well, then hirelings they are, and haue beene, but too much, and too long, by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, &amp; therefore as you tell them, the iudgement of God denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Eze.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 33, is that, that they may make their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of; which beeing ſo I cannot ſee how their verieſt enemies ſhould wiſh them to be worſe: yet let vs ſee what reaſon you haue to proue, that they may not bee rightly called wolues? Your reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the phraſe of the Scripture you thinke there muſt needs be betwixt an hireling and a woulfe, ſpoken of therein, the ſame difference that is betwixt a naughty, careleſſe, and a negligent ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and the woulfe that commeth in the meane time to pray of his flocke: whereupon the hireling with you, is as the ſheephearde, but careles and negligent in looking to his ſheepe, &amp; the woulfe is as the heretick and falſe teacher, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth whiles the other is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, &amp; driues the ſheepe from the folde, &amp; deuours them. But you know that ſimilitudes are not to be ſtreatched further then they are brought in, &amp; vſed for, that notwithſtanding, ſeeing you your ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hereticke is the woulfe, we ſhal well inough maintaine our calling of your Popes and Biſhops, wolues, I warrant you. For that is the thing eſpecially that wee ſtood vpon with you, and we deſire nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you would come once to the ſound
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18269:204"/> triall of that point, by the Canonicall ſcriptures, whither you and they haue not beene moſt daungerous heretiques. Hereſie we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any opinion conceiued, helde, and ſtubburnly defended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſound grounds of diuinity ſet downe vnto vs, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſcriptures. And your Religion to ſtand, &amp; conſiſt of a great number of ſuch, we are alwaies moſt ready to proue. It is not your ſaying, that your Religion is ancient, and receiued and taught al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the Church of God, from Chriſt, to this day; nor your brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny it, as you doe here again in the later ende of this Chapter, and haue often heretofore; that will ſerue the turne in this caſe; for I haue diuerſe times heretofore proued the contrarie. This is flat, euery one ſeeth it, you can hide it no longer, that if your Religion be ſo in deede, as you ſay, then you dare bring it vnto this touchſtone of the ſcripture; and it wil abide it; otherwiſe that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ſay to countenance it, with your wordes, or with the names, and titles, of ancient fathers and doctours, that in deede and trueth, it is not as you pretend. I haue meetly well already ſhewed the oppoſition and contrariety betwixt your doctrine &amp; that, taught in the Scriptures, <hi>cap.</hi> 29. and elſewhere: and yet were it an eaſie matter to lead on the reader, to a number of ſuch groſſe contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more, betwixt the doctrine of your Popes, and Biſhops, for a long time; and that which is taught there. For it teacheth that <hi>God worketh euen in the regenerat, both to will, &amp; to performe, euen of his owne good pleaſure. Phil.</hi> 2.13. and you contrariwiſe teach in your doctrine of free will. That teacheth vs flatly, <hi>that as there is but one God, ſo ther is but one mediatour betwixt God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the man Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> 1. <hi>Timot.</hi> 2. and you ſet vs vp a number of mediatours &amp; aduocates, of ſaints and Angels beſides him. There we are taught that <hi>no man can lay any other foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then that which is already laied Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. and your church hath laied <hi>Peter</hi> for the foundation of the church. And in this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are taught, <hi>to worſhip the lord God &amp; him only to ſerue Deut.</hi> 6. and namely the ſeruice of praier, beeing one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and diuineſt pointes of ſeruice that wee are to yeelde vnto him, there we are taught by commandement, promiſſe, and example, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe vnto him: and you come and teach vs to worſhip &amp; to ſerue euen with diuine honour, and namely with this of praier, not onely ſaints &amp; Angels, but alſo their reliques, ſhrines, and images. What ſhould I ſay more? your owne conſciences tell you that you haue
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18269:204"/> nothing in the world to eſcape this, &amp; 1000. more ſuch contrarieties betwixt your doctrin and the reueiled wil of God in the ſcriptures, but by ſubtle ſophiſtrie, fonde quiddities, and diſtinctions deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of your owne heades, without all warrant and ground fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which in matters and queſtions of diuinity is intollerable. Theſe and ſuch like contrarieties betwixt the doctrine of your Popes and Prelates, and the trueth taught in the ſcriptures, we hauing oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and tolde them of, and yet finding them moſt obſtinatly to perſiſt in the ſame, hath cauſed vs rather in reſpect of their hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine, to call them wolues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reſpect of their negligence onely heretiques. And for this ſame cauſe, ſeeing all yours are thus infected, you wiſh vs in vaine to ioyne ſome of the beſt of them, with ſome of the beſt of ours, to reforme things amiſſe in both. For there is no hope of any good reformation at all, where any ſuch as yours, haue any thing to doe therein. And ſeeing it is and hath beene ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a thing with vs (as you cannot be ignorant, if you haue reade anie of our bookes writen againſt you) to denie, that you continue in the doctrine which was preached vnto you at the firſt, yea ſeeing you all know, that we count your ſynagogue Antichriſtian, for her manifold Apoſtaſies from the ancient doctrine of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, taught firſt vnto the Romans, I wonder with what face or forehead, you could write as you do in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of this Chapter, that we our ſelues cannot denie, if we will confeſſe the trueth, but that you haue continued in the doctrine that was firſt preached vnto you. And therefore not onely for your lewdnes of life, and negligent ſheepherds, &amp; bad ſheepe, doeth your kingdome decay (as you would inſinuate) but eſpecially for this alſo, that in the points we ſtriue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you about, you are quite gone from the ancient ſound Catholique faith and religion, firſt taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and continued many yeares in the ancient Roman church &amp; others. The only way therefore for you is, to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an vtter &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall ſubuerſion and confuſion, firſt to returne againe from your new Antichriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; doctrine, to the true ancient &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith taught in the ſcriptures, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to amend your maners according to the direction of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>AT laſt it ſeemeth by your paines taken in this Chapter, you be thought your ſelfe, that foraſmuch as hitherto onelie in bare and naked wordes, you had vaunted and bragged your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be the ancient Religion: that it was needefull for you eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſhame before you made a full end of your booke, to yeeld vs ſome reaſons and grounds, or at leaſt ſome ſhew &amp; colour, of your ſo lewd and bold boaſting. And therefore here now at laſt, to that ende you haue muſtered the bare names of a few ancient fathers, very proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently leauing your Readers to the examining of your quotations, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whom not one of an hundreth you knew, either for lacke of ſkill or will, leaſure or bookes, could and would turne to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the authours themſelues. You thought (belike) your credit to bee ſuch, that they muſt needes beleeue that you cite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truely and faithfully: and that becauſe you ſo roundly haue huddled them togither, that therefore alſo out of all queſtion they ſpake and wrotefully for you, in the points you alleadge them for. What ſmal cauſe there is either for you to looke thus to bee truſted, or for any to yeelde you ſuch credit herein, wee ſhall ſee anone, when wee come to the examining of your quotations. In the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18269:206"/> meane time, what ment you by this, thus onely when all commeth to al, to countenance theſe 4, points: your Ceremonies in baptiſme, confeſſion before the ſacrament, praiers to the Saints departed, and praier for the dead? Are theſe the greateſt matters of your religion in queſtion? Or doeth it eſpecially depend vpon theſe 4, and the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of theſe? Or was your prouiſion ready for no more, that but once in all your booke, you ſeeming to ſet downe the authorities whereupon you ground your religion, you would take the paines to go no further then to theſe 4, points? Indeed in your next Chapter you excuſe your ſelfe and ſay, that you would haue gone likewiſe on to confirme the reſt, but for being tedious to your reader. Truely he is much beholden to you, for your diſcreet kindnes towards him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue not ſpared to be tedious vnto him in al the reſt of your book, in troubling of him with ſuch a number of proud brags, of the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and catholikenes of al your religion (as you haue) and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny needles and friuolous long diſcourſes beſides, and now when you came to the point indeed, which of all other was moſt materiall, and wherein both for his ſatiſfaction and your owne credit, it ſtood you vpon moſt to enlarge your ſelfe, then thus to ſhift him of, with as good as nothing, bearing him yet in hand, that but for his eaſe, you both could and would haue ſaied inough. This is a common tricke amongſt you, thus to cozen and abuſe your ſimple readers, to weary them with things needles, and then to ſlip ouer with ſome ſuch ſhift as this, matters moſt needful. Wel concerning that which either you haue ſaied here for theſe 4, points, or that which after you pretend, if you had liſt you could haue eaſily ſaied for the reſt; this I would haue the reader diligently to note and marke, that but for two places vainely alleaged to proue your confeſſion, that you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue alleaged any teſtimony of ſcripture at all for the proofe of theſe, nor yet that you ſo much as ſay after you could or would for the reſt. Which argueth that euen in your owne conſcience, the beſt ground and countenance that your popiſh religion hath, either in theſe points, or in the reſt, is but from earth, and not from heauen, from men, and not from the holy ghoſt. For if you had beene able with any good colour to haue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced either theſe points, or any of the reſt, out of Gods owne booke and writen word, the reader may think that neither your zeale to your religion, nor yet your boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſpirit, which hitherto hath ſhewed it ſelfe ouerflowing in you, either would or could haue ſuffered you, thus much to the preiudice
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18269:206"/> your whole cauſe, cleane to haue forgotten, ſo much as once to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But to ſay the trueth, ſeeing it is confeſſed by your betters, not onely that this, but the moſt of all the reſt of the points of your Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we ſtriue with you for, are grounded but vpon tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I haue ſhewed out of <hi>Soto</hi> againſt <hi>Brentius, Caniſius</hi> fift Chapter of his Catechiſme, and <hi>Lyndans</hi> 100. Chapter of the fifth booke of his panoply before) you are the honeſter man, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more a great deale to be liked, for your thus ſecretly confeſſing the ſame with them. Now yet by this, the Reader may plainely vnderſtand, what hath indeede beene the reaſon, why in all your booke hitherto you haue laboured ſo much as you haue, to grace and countenance tradition and the expoſition of the doctours, and withall haue ſpent ſo much time, in diſwading the appealing to the Scriptures, for the ending of the controuerſies betwixt vs. You were wiſe enough (it ſeemeth) to ſee where your ſtrength lay, and from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would riſe your bane, and therefore who can blame you for leaning, as you doe, altogither to the one, and ſhunning the other? But then in reaſon yet you ſhould call your Religion no more diuinity, but humanity, no more Theologie but patrologie: and plainely confeſſe indeede from whence you haue all your figge leaues, rags and clouts, to couer your ſhame and nakednes. Truely theſe you haue (whatſoeuer in this reſpect you pretend) not from the right and ſound Apoſtolique tradition (which alwaies was either expreſſed in Scripture, or at leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant vnto it) nor from the ancient holy fathers rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and when they taught (as it was of themſelues acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be their duties) with ſound warrant from the ſcriptures (as I haue ſundry times ſhewed already) but onely from forged, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tradition, and from the fathers either miſunderſtood, or erring as men. So that vnwriten verities or rather forgeries, ſentences of fathers miſtaken, or their verie errours whereof they would haue beene aſhamed, if they had had the meanes to helpe them to ſee them that you haue; are the groundes, pillers, and bewties of your church and Religion. And this we are alwaies ready to iuſtifie againſt you before the whole world, by ſound and inuincible proofe out of the vn doubted word of God (interpreted according to the ſame rules of interpreting it, that the holy and ancient fathers themſelues haue followed, in confuting all heretiques in their times by, and which they haue likewiſe commended to others alwaies to be obſerued) and out of the vndoubted writings of the ancienteſt and beſt fathers
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18269:207"/> them ſelues. Wee are therefore verie well content to liue and die in that Church and Religion, which we are ſure we are able thus to iuſtifie, and we enuy not you, but rather heartely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pittie you, that yours hath no better grounde then it hath.</p>
                  <p>But to let theſe thinges paſſe, and to proceede to the ſcanning and examining of that which you haue ſet downe in this Chapter; you beginne with an arrogant and falſe bragge, that all ancient doctours, Greeke and Latin ſince the Apoſtles times, and all the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure quarters of the world, that were in thoſe daies, made their promiſes and vowes &amp;c. as you doe now. You are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull generall (Maſter <hi>Albine</hi>) and your words are very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſwelling; ſhal we thinke that you are a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that learning and reading, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſpeake all this vpon your owne knowledge? why then hauing ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, &amp; ſuch an army royall, alleage you ſo few of them? nine or ten be the moſt whoſe names you haue brought vs in al this Chapter, and theſe you haue brought forth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſtage dumbe, or tongue-tied, if we wil here them ſpeake, we muſt take the paines to attend vpon them, by your direction, at an other time, and ſurely in other places then you haue pointed vs, we muſt heare a good ſort of theſe ſpeake for you, or elſe we ſhal neuer finde them willing, to yeelde either you or your cauſe, any one word good or bad. As for vowes and promiſes, which you make to God, vnleſſe thereby you meane onely ſuch vowes and promiſes, as both you and we make in our baptiſme, to renounce the Diuell and al his works &amp;c. for then you haue not ſo much as named vs one father, Greeke or Latin, nor yet any one Chriſtian of any of the foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, you ſpeake of. And indeede you haue amongſt you, ſuch raſh, fooliſh, vndiſcreete, and ſuperſtitious vowes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a number, for the which you could not, nor cannot truely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge any ancient and holy father or Chriſtian indeede, thereinto giue you any countenance. Such bee you vow of ſingle and chaſt life, vniuerſally amongſt you tyed to holy orders, your vowes and promiſes to God, ſome of you alwaies, &amp; ſome for a time, to abſteine with opinion of holines and merit, from fleſh and whitmeate, your vowes of pilgrimage, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit idolatry at this! Saints ſhrine &amp; pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or at that, and a number of like ſtampe; of which kinde of vows &amp; promiſes, if you meane, I ſay firſt, your glory in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is your ſhame, for theſe are but plaine wil worſhips, condemned by Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18269:207"/> and by <hi>Paul Coloſſ.</hi> 2. &amp; the very bronds &amp; marks of ſuch, as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>S.

And further I ſay ſuch vowes were better neuer made, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made, &amp; being made, they are of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature, &amp; dangerous conſequence, that the beſt way were firſt to repent of the folly and raſhnes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, &amp; then rather quite to giue them ouer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſuch ſuperſtition and impiety to ſeeke to keepe them, as is vſed &amp; breaks forth thereby ſhamefully amongſt you. For it is plentifully proued, both out of ſcriptures and out of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond canon of the eighth cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that oathes that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne are vnlawfull &amp; not to binde. And you cannot be ignorant, that <hi>Gratian, cauſa</hi> 22, <hi>queſt.</hi> 4, produceth many teſtimonies out of the fathers to the ſame end, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> namely out of <hi>Iſidor</hi> there, he hath noted &amp; ſet downe this, for a good rule in ſuch caſes as theſe of yours be. <hi>In malis promiſsis reſcinde fidem, in turpi voto, muta decretu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quod incautè vouiſti ne facias, impia eſt promiſsio quae ſcelere adimpletur,</hi> that is, in euill promiſſes performe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, in a filthie vow change thy purpoſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which raſhly thou haſt vowed doe not, it is an vngodly promiſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is fulfilled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſin.

                  <p>But by the vowes and promiſes that you ſpeake of, ſeeing you cite no fathers for any other, I will take it that you meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you vſe to make to God in Baptiſme. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vnderſtand, you ſtriue without an aduerſary.

Though it were graunted you, that theſe ſeuen in theſe places, were for your ceremonies which you vſe in baptiſme, yet this were farre from all that you ſpake of before.

Exorciſme, abrenuntiation, croſſing, thriſe dipping, and anointing, are all that I can finde any of theſe in any of theſe places to haue mentioned; but that they vſed the ſelfeſame exorciſmes, adiurations and anointings that you now vſe (as you ſay) I finde not. Your Chriſme that you anoint withall, muſt haue, as you hold, balſom in it: and in them I finde onely mention of oyle and none of any balſom, &amp; your formes of exorciſing and adiuring, ſet downe in your ſeruice bookes, are not found in any of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay it is well enough knowen they are of younger yeares by a faire deale. But what are theſe few ceremonies (the names where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and vſe whereof, in ſome ſort they had common with you) to al the ſolemnity of ceremonies that you vſe now? To trauell no further for the matter, let vs but take a view of your rites and ceremonies in this caſe, as they are ſet downe in your late Catechiſme, by the decree of the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> the fift Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writen and publiſhed for the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your pariſh Prieſts, what and how to teach their people: and we ſhall finde that theſe places, doe not mention the one halfe of them, by farre. There firſt, they are deuided in three rankes or ſortes, the firſt is of them that you by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that councell, vnder paine of being anathematized, muſt vſe before the partie to be baptiſed come to the font: the ſecond is of ſuch as be vſed in the baptizing of him, and the third is of ſuch as be vſed after. Of the firſt ſtampe be theſe: conſecrating of the water,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18269:208"/> with the oile of miſticall vnction, of Eaſter day and Whitſonday, that ſhall ſerue for the whole yeare after, as there ſhal be occaſion to vſe it, the ſtaying of the party without the Church dore, vntill he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelfe or his Godfather for him, promiſe the forſaking of the ſeruice of Sathan, and his yeelding to enter into Gods ſeruice and family, and being aſked what he would haue, anſwere be giuen, that he would haue baptiſme: which being knowen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaied fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is to be inſtructed in the Catheciſme, and is to anſwere it by himſelfe, or his godfather, which done, then in religious words and praiers, exorciſme or adiuration to expell the deuil, and to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ouerthrow his power in him, muſt be vſed, a little ſalt muſt be put into his mouth, the ſigne of the Croſſe is to be made vpon his forehead, eies, breſt, ſhoulders, and eares, and laſtly with the prieſts ſpettle, his noſtrels and eares, muſt be anointed. Now theſe things thus finiſhed, then he is admitted or brought to the font, where next follow the rites of the ſecond order, which there are thus ſet downe, then is he thriſe aſked whither he doe abre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thriſe he or his godfather make anſwere <hi>abrenu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio,</hi> I doe abrenou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; and then likewiſe he is aſked, whither he doe beleeue the twelue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian faith, whereunto anſwere is made, <hi>credo,</hi> I beleeue; and laſtly, whither he will be baptized is demaunded, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto anſwere being made, <hi>volo,</hi> I will: he is baptized in the water in the font, in the name of the father, the ſonne and holy Ghoſt, either being dipt into the water, or by hauing water poured or ſprinkled v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, according to the maner and faſhion of the Church in that countrey, where the party is baptized. Where is alſo further ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was the minde of that holy councel, that at the moſt there ſhould be but one godfather, and one godmother, thus to anſwere and vndertake for the baptized, both becauſe the order of diſcipline and inſtruction thorough a multitude of maſters might be troubled, and alſo becauſe it was meet ſo to prouide, leaſt otherwiſe betwixt too many, ſuch ſpirituall affinities ſhould grow, as might hinder mariadge amongſt men, too much. For as the writer of that booke further ſaieth, moſt wiſely by the Church it was decreed, that there ſhould grow ſuch affinity not onely betwixt the baptized and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizer, but alſo betweene the baptized and the ſureties, and the baptized his true parents, that thenceforth none of them might marry togither. That alſo may not be forgotten, that there alſo it is ſhewed, that the naturall parentes of the party to bee

And whereas you, vnder your Tridentine curſe, would binde all churches to the ſtrict obſeruing of all theſe your ſolemne ceremonies: you know, or at leaſt ſhould, that that is contrary to the ancient doctrine of Chriſtian liberty in ſuch things, and to the practiſe and experience of the primitiue Church. <hi>Annicet</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the Eaſt Church, and the Weſt (you know) a long time freely differed about the time of the obſeruation of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and yet <hi>pacem</hi> (ſaieth <hi>Irenaeus) in vniuerſâ eccleſiâ &amp;c.</hi> that is, both parts throughout the whole church, kept and maintained chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peace, <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. and ſo likewiſe there hee ſhewes, that there had beene a long time great difference, about the faſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eaſter, both for the time of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance and otherwiſe, &amp; yet that thereby rather in his opinion, the vnity of faith was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended then hindred. And of <hi>Gregories</hi> anſwere to <hi>Leander,</hi> touching the dipping of the baptized once or thriſe (the anſwere being as it was &amp;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18269:210"/> is reported by your owne <hi>Gratian, de conſecr. diſt.</hi> 4. that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the party was once or thriſe dipped, it was to be counted bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, you might learne that there is no ſuch neceſſity as you imagine, to haue generally throughout the whole church of Chriſt, one preciſe forme of rites &amp; ceremonies to be kept, that touch leſſe the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial parts of the ſacrament, then this did. That <hi>Gregory</hi> could ſay (to fortifie that anſwere of his) <hi>in vnâ fide nihil officit ſanctae eccleſiae conſuetudo diuerſa,</hi> that is, the diuerſity of cuſtome or faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth not hurt the church, continuing in one faith. And our Cronicles doe plainely teſtify, that neither <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the yeare 180. (though king <hi>Lucius</hi> here ſent vnto him for the Roman lawes to frame his people by) would binde him thereunto, nor yet the foreſaied <hi>Gregory</hi> anſwering <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monks queſtion, would tie him then, for the ordering of the church here, to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and cuſtomes of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the firſt ſent <hi>Lucius,</hi> for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to the lawes of God, being without exception, and not to the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laws, which might (he confeſſeth) be reproued, and the other in his anſwere to <hi>Auguſtines</hi> third demaund, how it came to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faith being but one, the ceremonies and cuſtoms were ſo diuers, as that there was one maner of maſſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; an other in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> wils him without reſpect of place, out of many churches, to chuſe the beſt orders. And who ſo will reade <hi>Socrates</hi> 5. booke and the 18.19.20.21 <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. Chapters of the ſame, he ſhall there finde not onely in a number of things diuerſe faſhions, rites and ceremonies, noted by him to haue bene in the churches of Chriſt (inſomuch that in the 21. Chapter not onely he writeth, that altogither truely and in al obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances of godly praiers, two churches could not be found, that did fully agree amongſt themſelues) but alſo, that this notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnity of faith, &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace was preſerued &amp; maintained amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them. The like may be ſeene in <hi>Zozomens</hi> 7. booke &amp; 29. Chapter. Your owne Tridentine Catechiſer of your pariſh Prieſts could ſee (as I noted before) that touching dipping the party to be baptized in water, pouring it vpon him, or ſprinkling him with it (ſo that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one follow therein that order, that hee ſeeth in vſe in the Church wherein hee is) it is not materiall which way be vſed, for which of them ſoeuer be vſed, ſo (ſaieth he) this ſacrament may rightly be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. So much the ſtranger is it, that both you here and he there, &amp; your whole Tridentine councel, ſhould ſo peremtorily ſeeke to bind all churches and perſons, to the ſtrict keeping and obſeruing of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18269:211"/> all your foreſaied rites and Ceremonies, in the ad miniſtring of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point, I muſt tell you, that for your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I hauing turned to theſe places, which you quote for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as I finde, by comparing of yours with them, that they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you haue many that they ſpeake neuer a word of in theſe places (as namely your conſecrating of your water and Chriſme ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before, your dealing with the party at the church dore, your putting of ſalt into his mouth, your dreſſing his noſtrels and eares withſpettle, and your giuing him a waxe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle burning into his hand) ſo thereby and by view of ſome other places in them, I plainely ſee, that you haue now giuen ouer the vſe of ſome, which then were vſed, vpon the like ground that the reſt were, which you would ſeeme to haue from them. For firſt <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke <hi>de coronâ militis</hi> (which is the ſecond place you quote) as there he mentions thriſe dipping, renouncing of the Deuill, his pompe and Angels, which you would ſeeme to allow and vſe with him, ſo he ſaieth, that being taken from out of the water, we taſt before hand the temper of milke and honie, and from the time of our baptiſme, for a weeke, we abſteine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhing, and all theſe doeth he ground a like, ſaying <hi>Harum &amp; aliarum diſciplinarum &amp;c.</hi> that is, of theſe diſciplines, if thou requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſt the law of the ſcripture, thou ſhalt finde none, tradition ſhall be pretended to be the authour, cuſtome the confirmer, and faith the obſeruer; &amp; yet you haue left theſe two laſt long ago, for any thing, that I can learne. And <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> an other of your authours in this caſe, in three of the places named by you mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s exufflation which you haue giuen ouer, as he doeth ſome other, that you retaine. And the ſame authour vpon the 65. Pſalme ſhewes, that in their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme they vſed fire, becauſe it is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalm, <hi>paſsing through fire and water thou ſhalt come to a refreſhing:</hi> and in his 4. booke <hi>ad cathecumenos, de Symbolo, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. he ſaieth, <hi>that before baptiſme, was vſed beſide the Catechiſme, exorciſme, praier and canticles: in ſufflation, ſackcloth, bowing of the neck &amp; humility of the feet.</hi> And <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon the 55. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferians</hi> ſhewes further, <hi>that then was vſed the taſting of wine and hony.</hi> Wherefore if the doctours and fathers, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſome of your ceremonies, binde you to thinke the vſe thereof lawfull and neceſſarie ſtill, why ſhould not their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie bee of as great force for theſe, which you ſee, they ground
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18269:211"/> aſwell as they doe the other? And if their mentioning and thus grounding of theſe notwithſtanding, you will be at liberty to leaue theſe, why may not we aſwell be at our libertie to leaue off ſome of the other, that we finde moſt needles, and moſt to haue beene abuſed by you, to obſcure and darken the ſimple inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Wil you follow the fathers as farre as you liſt, and leaue them when you liſt, and may no body but you doe ſo? Moreouer in looking (vpon this occaſion) into the monuments of antiquity, and the writings of the ancient fathers, I muſt needes aduertiſe thee (Chriſtian reader) that I finde great variety, in the enumeration of ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this ſacrament in them, and likewiſe great oddes betwixt the opinion and conceite, that ſome of the fathers ſhewe they had of them, from that that others, of as good credit as they, had: whereby it is euident, not only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were not vſed alike al in euery place, but in ſome places and times more, and in ſome leſſe: but alſo that ſome vſed them to one ende, and ſome to another. So that no certaine rule either for the ceremonies themſelues, or for the maner or ende of the vſe of them, can be deduced from thence. Whereupon it muſt needes follow, that for any thing writen by the ancient fathers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (ſo that the eſſentiall parts and things belonging hereunto, which haue expreſſe warrant from the inſtitution thereof, be obſerued firſt, and then next according to the practiſe and example of the Apoſtles, and the times next after them, neceſſary inſtruction and explanation to and of the right vſe thereof, with conuenient praiers and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, meete to be vſed in ſuch an action bee vſed, and that alſo in due time and place, by, to &amp; before fit perſons) any Church of Chriſt in any kingdome by the prouinciall authority that it hath, may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiect ſo many of the other rites &amp; ceremonies as it ſhall thinke good, and likewiſe reteine ſo many of them, as ſhe findeth may fitly bee reteyned for order and comelineſſe, without placing any opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of neceſſity, holineſſe or of merit in them. And therefore, foraſmuch as our Churches carefully haue taken this courſe in theſe three points, and follow the ſame in trueth, there is nothing, that theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that you haue named, conſent vpon, about the adminiſtring of this ſacrament, but we fully doe obſerue the ſame. And here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> eſpecially what fault can you find? Of the 5. things your fathers mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we reteine &amp; vſe, though not with any ſuperſtitious intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as you do) 2 of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the reſt we haue cut of according both to <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> aduiſe, &amp; your pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> iudgement before noted, becauſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18269:212"/> the multitude before was too great for the time of the Goſpel, &amp; they were growen into groſſe abuſe amongſt you. No eſſential or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to bee done is omitted with vs, and wee haue beſides fully inough, for the time of the new Teſtament wherin we liue, in which time it is more likely in ſuch ceremonies. rites and faſhions for vs to erre, rather in retaining too many, then in aboliſhing too many.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe neither you ſhal ſay, nor your reader thinke, y theſe fathers, whoſe names you bring vs, to countenance al your ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which you vſe about baptiſme, are ſo ful &amp; faſt of your ſide ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as you pretend: I wil vouchſafe ſo much further paines, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly to examine al your quotations out of them. The firſt man you name is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and in him you ſend vs to two places; for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and abrenuntiation, to his booke <hi>de reſurrectione carnis:</hi> and for thriſe dipping, to his booke <hi>de coronâ militis.</hi> Wherin it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a little you miſtooke your notes: for there is no mention of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation that I can finde in the former place, in the later indeede there is: but you quote the former for it &amp; not the later at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any man may ſee, you tooke your quotations vpon truſt, and neuer tooke the paines to turne to the places in the authours themſelues, and that ſo it came to paſſe, that that which you ſhould haue fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the later place (through ignorance) you haue attributed to the former. Anointing, I find me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the former place (I gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) but neither the matter nor form of your anointing, can I either find ther or in any other place, quoted by you for it. And in the other, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth thriſe dipping, but to what purpoſe is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, to iuſtifie your ceremonies or maner of baptizing, ſeeing (as I haue noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, out of your Tride<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine cathechiſm) in this point you are ſo indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whither it be miniſtred by dipping, powring, or ſprinkling, &amp; neuer once there preſcribe, this faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thriſe dipping as neceſſary? Your ſecond authour is <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who (you ſay) in the ſecond volume of his Epiſtles, Epiſt. the twelfth doeth write, that the holy Chriſme was giuen vnto children that were baptized. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your note gatherer abuſed you. For doubtleſſe in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there is not one worde, either of Chriſme or anie other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies about baptiſme. Indeed in the 12, Epiſtle of his firſt book of Epiſtles, he ſpeakes of anointing the baptized with oile, but holy chriſme he calleth it not. But to ſpeake the trueth, both <hi>Tertullian</hi> and he, haue not onely in their workes ſundry times mentioned Chriſme and anointing of the baptized; but they went too farre
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18269:212"/> both in vrging the neceſſity thereof, and in attributing vnto it ſuch diuine grace as they did: inſomuch, that it is not without cauſe of the learned thought, that therin they were both the ſchollers of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus.</hi> But certaine it is, of whomſoeuer they learned thus to vrge this ceremony, to the obſcuring &amp; preiudicing of the vſe and effects of baptiſme, as too groſſely they did, in tying rather the gift of the holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie and regenerate to it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to baptiſme, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learned it other of Chriſt, nor of any ſound Chriſtian, nor may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian more think himſelfe bound to vrge it, and vſe it as they did, becauſe they did ſo, then he is bound to be a Montaniſt, becauſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> was ſo, or to holde rebaptization of them, that before were baptized of heretiques, becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> did ſo. Your nexte man is <hi>Origen,</hi> to whoſe 12. <hi>Homilie,</hi> without any further additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to diuerſe other places of his workes (without naming vnto vs any of theſe places) you ſend vs, for abrenuntiation and the ſigne of the Croſſe to bee made in the baptiſed his forehead, wherin it was your hap, to ſhew as great negligence and ignorance as might bee. For <hi>Origen</hi> wrote many times 12. <hi>Homilies</hi> (as it is to be ſeene in his works) whereas it ſhould ſeeme by your kind of quoting of him, that you thought he had done ſo but once, and yet in none of theſe 12. <hi>Homilies</hi> that he wrote, finde I theſe two ceremonies mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and as for the diuerſe other places in his works, that you ſpeake of, when you ſhall vouchſafe to name them, your anſwere will bee as eaſily made. Next is <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> of whom you alleage two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his 12. <hi>Homily</hi> vpon the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, cap.</hi> 4. and his firſt <hi>Homilie</hi> vpon the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and both theſe onely for renuntiation. In the firſt whereof, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſigne of the Croſſe made in the forehead, but not expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Baptiſme, and in the other there is mention of renuntiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but ſo there is not at al in the former: wherby againe one may ſee, how you neuer turned to theſe places and read them your ſelfe: and beſides it is euident, that either through ignorance or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or both, you father that vpon your former noted place, which you ſhould attribute to the later: as here, that vpon <hi>Origen,</hi> which you ſhould haue left to <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and ſo ſhew your errour in both. But what were all this (if you had not beene at all thus ouerſeene) againſt vs, or for you more, then for vs; ſeeing both theſe ceremonies or rites, are reteyned and vſed amongſt vs, in farre better maner then with you. Now followeth <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> out of whom you
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18269:213"/> quote vs, <hi>in Pſalm.</hi> 31. <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>contra Iulianum Pelagianum. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Item de nuptiis &amp; concupiſcentiâ. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>In Iohannem tract.</hi> 33. <hi>In Canonicam Iohannis, tract.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; tra.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; de Eccleſiaſt. dogmatibus Cap.</hi> 31. <hi>De Symbolo lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; libro de his qui initiantur ſacris,</hi> that is, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen places in all, wherein yet you haue more groſſely ſhamed your ſelfe, then in the former. For firſt of all in theſe eleuen pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are but three, wherein I finde any mention of any of your ceremonies, and that is, in his firſt booke and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt <hi>Iulian,</hi> in his firſt booke and twentieth Chapter <hi>de nuptiis &amp; concupiſcentiâ,</hi> and in his thirty one Chapter <hi>de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticis dogmatibus:</hi> and lay all theſe three togither, and there are mentioned onely three, that is, exorciſme, exufflation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renuntiation, whereof we vſe one aſwell as you, namely abrenuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as for the other two, thereof you your ſelues haue but the firſt, and therefore why may not we aſwell, giue ouer both the other, as you haue done the firſt of them. Secondly, you ſend vs indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to his fifteene booke (as you did before to <hi>Origens</hi> twelfth homily) not telling vs what 15. booke you meane, thinking (belike) that he had neuer wrote but once 15. books of one title, wheras eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that is acquainted with his works, know the contrary. If you ſay you meant his 15 booke againſt <hi>Iulian,</hi> then therein you ſhew as much ignorance: for againſt him, he wrote but 6. Thirdly, you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon <hi>Aug.</hi> two books <hi>de ſymbolo,</hi> &amp; one <hi>de his qui initiantur ſacris,</hi> whereas indeed in al <hi>Auguſtines</hi> tomes, there are no books y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſimply &amp; barely beare thoſe titles, to be found. He wrote one book <hi>de fide &amp; ſymbolo:</hi> &amp; 4 <hi>de ſymbolo ad cathecumenos:</hi> but in no 7 nor 11 Chapters of any of theſe, is there any thing for your purpoſe, but none at al he hath writen, that in title co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth any thing neare the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you father vpon him. But I imagine, that if your eie-ſight, or memory, had not failed you, you ſhould and would haue quoted theſe not in his name, but in <hi>Ambroſes.</hi> But yet then you took your mark amiſſe alſo. For he hath no bookes neither, that ſimply cary theſe titles. Indeed he hath writen fiue <hi>de fide ad Gratianum,</hi> and one <hi>de fide orthodoxâ, contra Arrianos,</hi> and a booke he hath writen, <hi>de his qui initiantur myſteriis,</hi> and fiue <hi>de ſacramentis,</hi> but in no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth nor eleuenth Chapters of any of his bookes <hi>de fide</hi> or <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo,</hi> hath he any thing to ſerue your turne. Neuer man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was ſo abuſed as you (Maſter <hi>Albine</hi>) were (I thinke) in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

I would therefore henceforth aduiſe you, vnleſſe you be euen reſolued vtterly to leeſe your credit, truſt no more thus either other mens eies or fingers. Well, <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> are yet behinde, let vs ſee if you hit any rightlier of your places out of them: you cite <hi>Baſils</hi> 15 and 75 Chapters <hi>de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu Sancto,</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> vpon the 27 <hi>Pſalme:</hi> Neither of which you haue rightly quoted. For there are but 30 Chapters in al <hi>Baſils</hi> booke <hi>de Spiritu Sancto</hi> (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath tranſlated him, &amp; cauſed him to bee publiſhed) and <hi>Arnobius</hi> vpon the twenty ſeuen <hi>Pſalme,</hi> hath not at all mentioned any ceremony about baptiſme, <hi>Baſil</hi> in his fifteene and twenty ſeuen Chapters of that booke, and <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> vpon the ſeuenty fiue <hi>Pſalme,</hi> make mention of abrenuntiation, &amp; of ſome other ceremonies, before mentioned by the other fathers: but yet neither theſe, nor all the other laied togither, that you haue named, either in the places mentioned by you, nor any where elſe, mention al the ceremonies which you vſe, by far, though you would by your lowd bragging make your reader beleeue they doe. Thus you ſee, vnleſſe you had beene diſpoſed vtterly for euer to ſhame your ſelfe, you could not in ſo few quotations, eſpecially not ſet on your margent, but in your lines as they are, the better to preuent wrong applying of them, haue beene taken with thus many groſſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightes. May not any man (worthilie thinke you) hereby iudge, that howſoeuer the names of the fathers are familiar with you, that yet you are a verie ſtranger in their workes indeed? Of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty places, you haue alleadged aright and to the purpoſe, ſcarſe fiue, and of ſeuen fathers (belike becauſe you would not deale par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallie with them) your happe hath beene, one waie or other, to erre in quoting of euerie one of them. Surelie you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee truſted vpon your bare word, without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of your quotations an other time, you haue dealt ſo faythfully and vprightlie in theſe. And to conclude this point withall, as though you had moſt rightly quoted, and that they moſt pregnantlie had iuſtified all your Ceremonies as you vſe them, you confidently tell your reader, that if hee will reade theſe places hee ſhall finde, that they did vſe the verie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that you doe vſe, and wee ſo much myſlike. Thus yet you coulde ſet a good face on the matter, though you could doe little elſe.</p>
                  <p>But in good earneſt, is it your meaning, by theſe places to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Sure I am, that none of your ceremonies that you ſtriue for here ſo much, which we miſlike, was vſed then to anie of them: and yet I am ſure neuer were any with theſe ceremonies of yours, better baptized, then theſe were. Nay to preſſe you a litle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if theſe ceremonies were ſo neceſſarie as you pretend, how cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it, that aboue 600. yeares after Chriſt (that is long after any of the fathers you haue named to countenance them withal) we read in <hi>Bedaes</hi> ſtory, ſo often me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion as we do, of ſo great multitudes, here in <hi>England,</hi> by famous Biſhops baptiſed in one daie in common ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? It is vnpoſſible that they ſhould baptiſe ſo many in ſo ſhort time as that ſtory ſhewes they did, and yet vſe to euery one, all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of ceremonies, that you here thus pleade for. It is cleare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that practiſe, that for all this, and whatſoeuer elſe any where, either theſe, or any other doctour, before that time had writen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that then there was no ſuch danger imagined to bee in omitting of theſe, as your Tridentine cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell now, would make men beleeue there is.</p>
                  <p>But for a general anſwere to al that you, or any of your ſide, haue or can alleadge out of any father, either for the iuſtifying your kinde of vſing theſe your ceremonies, or any of the other three points that follow in this Chapter (as long as you are not able to warrant your doings and opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therin, by the ſcriptures, which we are ſure you ſhall neuer be able to doe) by the fathers leaue, though they were as pregnant for you as you pretend (which they are not neither) &amp; that by the direction and aduiſe of the beſt of themſelues, we will &amp; may chuſe, for all their writings, whither we will like any whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them or no.

To go on therefore according to my courſe begun: for confeſſion before the receiuing of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, you ſaie firſt, our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt doeth teach vs, that the eccleſiaſticall miniſters haue authority to binde and to forgiue ſins: and for proofe hereof you ſet in your margent <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. I am ſure here by confeſſion, that you ſpeake of, you meane your auricular confeſſion, wherof your Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dentine councel taketh ſuch care, that that in the 6, 7, and 8, Canon thereof, touching this matter, it ſolemnely anathematizeth al thoſe, that hold auricular confeſſion not to be neceſſary to ſaluation, by the law of God, ſaying that it is but the deuiſe of man. Which they there haue defined to be a ſecret reckoning vp vnto the prieſt, of al mortal ſins at the leaſt, with al their circumſtances, whereof by due preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation the party can haue any remembrance, whereunto they bind all perſons aboue certaine yeares, of both ſexes, at leaſt once in the yeare, and that namely in lent, before their receiuing at Eaſter.

You meane, I am ſure, both by your words and quotations, that Chriſts doing and ſaying to his Apoſtles ſet downe by <hi>Matthew</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> in the places you quote in theſe words: <hi>to thee</hi> (ſpeaking namely in the firſt place to <hi>Peter) I wil giue the keies of the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde in earth, ſhal be bound in heauen, &amp; whatſoeuer thou looſeſt in earth ſhal be looſed in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And in the other, he breathed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſaied, <hi>receiue yee the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins yee remit, they are remitted, &amp; whoſe ſins yee retaine, they are retained.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indeed it is euident, that our Sauiour firſt promiſed to <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of al the reſt, &amp; after gaue to al his faithful Apoſtles, firſt the gift of the holy Ghoſt and then power and authority to vſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe the ſame power is exerciſed by
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18269:216"/> the Lords faithfull miniſters in his church ſtill, not by the helpe of your eare-ſhriſt, pardons  but by their faithful preaching of the will of God, ſacraments miniſtring, and vſing of the other cenſures in due time and place. They haue a miniſtry of teſtification and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, by the rule and light of the ſcriptures, thorow the ſhining of Gods ſpirit in their hearts, to aſſure them that rightly vnderſtand them and beleeue them, of that aſſuredly: which God only doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, abſolutely and principally. But you ſeeme in thus alleadging of theſe places, firſt, ſo thinke that the power and authority y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt here gaue his Apoſtles to binde and looſe &amp;c. inueſteth them ſtreight with power and authority to binde euery man to make vnto them your auricular confeſſion: whereas we neither read that any did ſo vnto them, nor that they for all this, euer exacted any ſuch thing at any mans hands, that they dealt withall: and ſecondly, you ſeeme to take the power giuen them, and from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deriued to other miniſters here, to be ſuch, that they properly and abſolutely ſhould haue power to pardon ſinne. &amp;c. which is abſurd and blaſphemous for you once but to imagine. For ſo can none forgiue ſinnes, but God onely. How can you ſay or thinke, that a Prieſt properly or abſolutely can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue one of ſinne, ſeeing he may not ſo much, as pronounce or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a ſinner to be pardoned of God, vnles he be contrite, penitent, and faithfull indeede. Now God onely and the party are priuy to this, whither theſe thinges be ſound and right in the heart or no, for an hypocrite can make a ſhew to deceaue man withall in theſe (you know) vnles therfore we will thinke that we haue power to abſolue him whom God yet condemneth, our pronouncing of pardon or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to thoſe that ſeeme ſuch vnto vs, muſt be but conditionall, if they be ſuch in deede as they make ſhew for, and therefore neither is, nor can it be proper or abſolute. <hi>Ambroſe libro</hi> 3. <hi>de Spiritu Sancto ca.</hi> 19. by that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> proues the godhead of the holy ghoſt, for that he can and doeth forgiue ſinnes: which were no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if by that place, Chriſt meant to giue miniſters power and au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority properly and abſolutely to doe it, vnles it be lawful to think, that they are very Gods. But marke, I pray you, your kinde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from theſe places: Chriſt gaue to his Apoſtles power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (giuing them the holy Ghoſt) to bind and to forgiue ſins, <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> auricular confeſſion before the ſacrament thereby was enioynes: this is your argument, or elſe you ſaie nothing in all this for your ſelues againſt vs. For we deny not, but moſt willingly confeſſe, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18269:216"/> by theſe places it is certaine, that Chriſt gaue vnto his true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to whom he gaue the holy Ghoſt, power and authority as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to doe this. But what is this to authorize your prieſtes, which are no miniſters of his ordinance, and to whom hee hath not giuen that ſpirit to doe this? Or what is this if they had authority to doe it, either to that which they take vpon them, or to enforce a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch auriculer confeſſion, as you practiſe and pleade for?</p>
                  <p>Herein it is with you, as it is in other points of your religion, you are deceaued, and after ſeeke to abuſe and deceaue others, with the ambiguity and diuerſity of acceptions of confeſsion. For that is a common tricke with you, when you finde either in ſcripture or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is but the word mentioned, that by any ſtretching maie reach to your meaning, to alleadge that ſtreight, as flat, full and pregnant for your purpoſe, when as indeede, if the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the place he looked into, it is as far from countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing your opinion as may be. So in this caſe, you finding in ſcripture ſome mention of confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, and ſundry examples of the ſame, and likewiſe in the fathers, you finding that they exhort and perſwade men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes, you by and by imagined that your auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion muſt needes be that, that they ſpeake of, or at leaſt (your learning not ſuffering you ſo to imagin) you contrary to your owne knowledge and conſcience (as it ſeemeth) could be contented to doe what you could, to make your Reader ſo to thinke. Wherefore to arme him hereafter againſt your ſubtlety, or the cunning of any of your fellowes in this point, and ſo to giue him a triacle to preſerue him from the danger of your popiſh poiſon in this caſe, let him know and vnderſtand, that there haue beene and be, many kinds of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſinnes ſpoken of, both in ſcriptures and fathers, and yet you neuer the nearer for yours. For <hi>Auguſtine, de verbis Euangelii, hom.</hi> 8. very pretily, according to his maner ſaieth, that confeſſion is tither <hi>laudis</hi> or <hi>fraudis,</hi> that is, of praiſe or of fraude: by the former vnderſtanding that kinde of confeſſion, whereby we thankfullie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, what God hath beene or is vnto vs, we burſt forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lauding and prayſing his holy name therefore, whereunto the faithfull ſeruants of God are oftentimes exhorted in the ſcriptures, as for example, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 33. in theſe words, <hi>confeſſe vnto the Lord in harpe, and in a pſaltery of ten ſtrings ſing vnto him.</hi> And <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. in theſe, <hi>confeſſe vnto the Lord that he is good, and that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18269:217"/> his mercy is for euer,</hi> which kinde of confeſſion in our Churches we alwaies publickly vſe, both before and in the receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which wee teach to be a Sacrament euen to prouoke vs ſo to doe, for our free and full ſaluation purchaſed for vs by the death of Chriſt. And the other is the generall; to all kyndes and ſortes of confeſſion of ſinnes, which he tearmeth frawde, becauſe by all ſinne God or man, or both, are wronged of that which is due vnto them. Otherwiſe ſome diſtinguiſh confeſſion, into confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fayth and confeſſion of maners: of the firſt whereof, ſayeth Chriſt (<hi>Matthew</hi> the tenth) <hi>hee that confeſſeth mee before men, I will confeſſe him before my father which is in heauen:</hi> and of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>with the heart man beleeueth to righteouſneſſe, but with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> and this is farre more playnely in vſe with vs alſo then with you. For in all our publicke aſſemblies ordinarily (as it is wel knowen) according to the three auncient Creedes, in engliſh, that all preſent may vnderſtande vs, wee make confeſſion of our faith. And as for the later, which is confeſſion of our maners, there is no kinde of ſo confeſſing taught and commended vnto vs, either in the olde Teſtament or new, either to God or man, priuate or publicke, but wee vſe it, allowe it, and exhort one an other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, in farre better ſort and maner then you doe. Yea to go one ſtep further with you, there is no kynde of ſo confeſſing our faultes, by the conſent and vniforme practiſe of the auncient fathers appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto vs, but therein alſo both before the receite of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at other times (as occaſion ſerueth) wee are farre before you, how ſhort ſoeuer wee come of you, in allowing your auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confeſſion, which is the onelie kinde of confeſſion, that you plead here for. For looking firſt into the ſcriptures, and then into the ancient fathers, theſe are the onely kinds of ſo confeſſing agrees on, &amp; by one conſent of them, needful to be practiſed. Firſt that euery one of Gods people ſhoulde by the due meditation dailie of his lawe, ſo bring all his ſinnes originall and actuall, ſmall and great, publicke and ſecret, to his remembrance, that in trueth hee may ſaie with <hi>Dauid, Pſalme</hi> fiftie one, in reſpect of them all, in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>I knowe mine iniquities and my ſinne is alway before mee:</hi> that ſo with a contrite heart, hope of Gods mercy, and purpoſe of amendment, hee maie confeſſe them vnto God, both priuately and publickely, generally and particulerly alſo, vpon iuſt occaſions we
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18269:217"/> all, with the Scriptures and fathers allow, teach and practiſe. For it is well knowen in reſpect of this kinde of confeſſion of ſins, wee teach with <hi>Salomon, prouerb.</hi> the twenty eightth, <hi>hee that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his ſinnes hee ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth them and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.</hi> And therefore beſide our often confeſſing our ſinnes vnto God againſt our ſelues in priuate, in all our ordinary prayers either at home in our families, or in publicke, in our aſſemblies and congregations, eſpecially before the receiuing of the ſacrament, we make humble confeſſion of all our ſinnes and vnworthineſſe, generally vnto God. Thus did <hi>Dauid Pſalme</hi> thirty two and fifty one, thus did <hi>Daniel, Daniel</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Ezra: Ezra</hi> the ninth: yea thus did the publican <hi>Luke</hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, they that were baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan, Matthew</hi> the third, and the beleeuers that we read of <hi>Actes</hi> the nineteenth, <hi>verſ.</hi> eighteenth and nineteenth, confeſſe their ſinnes before God. This we count a neceſſary fruit of repentance, a good meanes to humble vs in the preſence of God, and a way to aduaunce both the iuſtice and mercy of our God. And to this, we knowe both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers all with one conſent exhort vs, but eſpeciallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the fathers, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is earneſt to perſwade this kinde of confeſſion of ſinnes to God, aboue all other, as it is to be ſeene in him, vpon the fifty <hi>Pſalme, hom.</hi> 2; vpon <hi>Matthew, hom.</hi> 3; vpon <hi>Geneſis hom.</hi> twenty; and vpon the twelfth of the <hi>Hebrues hom.</hi> the thirty one; and elſe where often in his works. As for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly confeſſing of our ſinnes vnto God in the preſence of the congregation, (as I ſayed before) alſo, vpon iuſt and due oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that is vrged, taught and practiſed amongſt vs. But then it is, but when one falleth into ſome ſuch notorious and great ſinne, publickely knowen to the offence of the Church, for the which hee deſerueth to bee excommunicated. And this is either voluntarilie yeelded vnto, and done by the partie that hath ſo offended, to ſhew the better his repentance: or it is by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie impoſed vpon ſuch, for the terrour of others, and ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the congregation offended. And hereof in Scripture we haue example. For <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne that ſo troubled the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, once being knowen and ſo publicke, by <hi>Ioſua</hi> hee is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to giue glorie to God, and ſo before <hi>Ioſua</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hee confeſſeth his ſinne at the appointment of <hi>Ioſua: Ioſua</hi> the ſeuenth: it ſeemeth likewiſe that the inceſtuous <hi>Corinth</hi> did, driuen
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18269:218"/> thereunto by the authoritie and force of that cenſure that <hi>Paul</hi> and that Church layed vpon him 1. <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 5. and 2. Epiſt. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and ſeuenth Chapters. And at the rebuke of <hi>Samuel</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple particulerlie confeſſed their ſinne in deſiring a king. 1. <hi>Samuel</hi> and twelfth, and at the rebuke of <hi>Ezra</hi> we read alſo voluntarily they came, that had contrary to the law of God maried ſtrange wiues, and publikely confeſſed their ſinnes and amended that fault. <hi>Ezra</hi> the tenth: of ſuch examples of particuler publicke confeſſing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious knowen faults, the eccleſiaſticall ſtories are full: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome yeelded thereunto voluntarily, who were alwaies beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of, and others by order of eccleſiaſtical cenſures were brought thereunto. And for this kinde of publicke confeſſing of our ſinnes to God alſo, it cannot bee denied, but herein wee are far beyond you, in conforming our ſelues therein far more then you, to the ancient preſidenes thereof, found both in Scripture and other antiquity. Indeede I muſt needes confeſſe, that I finde in the writings of the fathers, eſpecially in <hi>Cyprian, ſermone de lapſis,</hi> in <hi>Tertullian de paenitentiâ,</hi> and in <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the thirty ſeuen <hi>Pſalme, that they counted it a commendable thing, and an argument of greater feare of God and loue, if men would not onely thus confeſſe their notorious publickely knowen ſins, but alſo their ſecret notorious ſinnes, yea then very purpoſes onely to haue committed ſuch ſinnes.</hi> But withall I finde that they ſaw ſuch inconueniences to ariſe hereof, that firſt they counſelled ſuch therein to be directed firſt, by ſome godly diſcreet miniſter, when they ſhould ſo doe and when not: and ſecondly are long they were driuen to thinke it needfull, for the prouenting of ſome inconueniences, onely to enioyne them ſome publicke puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concealing the particularity of ſuch their ſinnes: and thirdly I finde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi> his time, this was thought to much alſo. For he in his ſeuenty eight Epiſtle, and as he is alleadged by <hi>Gratian de paenit. Diſtinct.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap. Quamuis.</hi> ſheweth his flat miſlyke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, determining it to bee farre better, that the confeſſion bee made onely to the miniſter. But in the Greeke Church long before <hi>Leo</hi> his tyme (as it appeareth in <hi>Zozomen libro.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. <hi>hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae tripart</hi>) this publiſhing of ſinnes by publicke confeſſion, or by enduring of ſome enioyned puniſhment publickely, was giuen ouer and one appointed in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to heare the confeſſions of ſuch as came vnto him: which order alſo, as it there appeareth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18269:218"/> was by <hi>Nectarius</hi> biſhop there, cauſed to be giuen ouer, by occaſion that a noble woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confeſſed, that ſhe had lyen with a Deacon there, in the Church, whiles ſhe was doing there the things y her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſour had enioyned her. So that to go on, by theſe and other ſuch places more in the fathers, I finde, that ſecret confeſſion of ſinnes to a miniſter indeede is ancient, and alſo I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I finde, the fathers often exhorting-men ſo to confeſſe their ſinnes; but yet then (good Chriſtian reader) thou muſt vnderſtand, that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>either vſed nor vrged, but in certaine caſes, as when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the party could not tell how to comfort himſelfe vnder the burden of his ſinne, or to get out of the ſnares and fetters thereof. It was neither taught nor vrged then as an ordinance of God to bee kept vnder paine of damnation, as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet were they vrged to make ſuch an exact enumeration of all their ſinnes, and the circumſtances thereof; as that Synagogue now teacheth. For then durſt not <hi>Nectarius</hi> (as is aforeſaied) haue abrogated that order, and haue thence forth left euery one whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he communicated, <hi>iudicio conſcientiae ſuae</hi> (as <hi>Zozomen</hi> there plainely affirmes he did) neither before that could one confeſſour haue ſerued for all the Chriſtians in that great and famous City, where I read in <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> time, there were ſixty miniſters. But this is the plaine trueth, it was vſed and exhorted vnto, as a good profitable order to be vſed ſo long, and ſo far forth: as they ſaw it needful, and a furtherance to vertue and godlineſſe. And this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the fathers by <hi>Albine</hi> here cited for auricular confeſſion, ſpeake onely either for publicke confeſſion, of publikly knowen notorious ſinnes, before the receit of the ſacrament: or elſe onely to perſwade men, when they feele themſelues ſicke of ſinne, and grieued with the burden thereof in conſcience, then to confeſſe ſuch their ſinnes vnto ſome godly diſcreet miniſter, that hath both ſkill and will to comfort their diſtreſſed ſoules. In which caſe and maner wee allow and like aſwell as they, that men ſhould ſo doe, and it is a thing much vſed and practized amongſt vs. There is laſtly a confeſſion of ſinne of one brother or Chriſtian, to an other whom he hath offended, to breed reconciliation againe betwixt the parties, taught by Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> the fift, and eighteenth Chapters, <hi>Luke</hi> the ſeuenteenth and <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth: allowed both by ſcriptures and fathers with one conſent: and this before the receit of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at all other tymes wee teach and vſe as very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18269:219"/> Other confeſſions then theſe we neither finde taught nor practized in the old Teſtament nor new, nor yet vrged by any of the ancient fathers you name, either in the places by you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, or elſe where; and therefore you haue but beene abuſed, and now ſeeke by the ſound of their names to abuſe others, whiles you would make men beleeue, becauſe they ſpeake of ſome of theſe kindes of confeſſing of ſinnes or other, in theſe places, that therfore they ſpeak for your Lenten ſhrift, or auricular confeſsion, which was not ſo much as once thought of by any of them, nor for many hundreth yeares after the lateſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by any other writer of credit. The queſtion indeede betwixt you and vs then in this poynt is not, whither ſinnes be to bee confeſſed at all before wee receiue. For yee ſee moſt willingly we confeſſe ſundry wayes they may and ought: but this is it, whither ſuch particuler and ſpeciall confeſſion of all our ſinnes and the circumſtances thereof, that we can poſſibly by due premeditation had thereof remember, in ſecret to a Prieſt, be by Gods ordinance abſolutely neceſſarie to remiſſion of ſinnes, for all of both ſexes once in the yeare at the leaſt or no. Wee holde the negatiue, and you the affirmatiue. That ſinnes haue beene, and may agayne bee in ſecret confeſſed to ſuch as be faithfull miniſters, and that the ſo doing ſome tyme, is very good and profitable, wee deny not, you ſee: but either to imagine ſuch a neceſſity as you teach thereof, or to bynde to ſuch a full enumeration of all at anie tyme, are the thinges wee ſaie which you can neuer proue, either by Scripture or father. For your owne <hi>Gratian,</hi> brings ſundry authorities before that <hi>Lateran</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, when firſt this your opinion of the abſolute neceſſity thereof, to ſaluation was aggreed vpon (as you may reade in him <hi>de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiâ Diſtinct.</hi> 1.) ſome for the neceſſity, and ſome to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereof, and in the end <hi>Cap. Quamuis:</hi> concludeth thus: to which of theſe opinions one ſhould rather ſticke, I leaue to the readers iudgement, for both partes (ſayeth hee) hath <hi>aſtipulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſapientes &amp; religioſos viros,</hi> that is, fauourers, men that are both wiſe and religious: and <hi>Panormitan</hi> a great Doctour of yours diſputeth the matter, that your confeſſion is not by Gods lawe but by mans. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> that ſucceeded <hi>Nectarius,</hi> ſo liked his predeceſſours act, of abrogating the order of ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion to the confeſſour, that he in his fourth ſermon of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Caue homini dixeris peccata, ne tibi opprobret &amp;c.</hi> that is,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18269:219"/> take heed that thou tell not thy ſinnes to man, leſt hee vpbraide thee with them, neither confeſſe them to thy fellowe ſeruaunt, that hee may publiſh them, but confeſſe them to God the Lorde: and the like he writeth <hi>hom.</hi> 31, vpon the 12 of the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> and vpon the fiftieth <hi>Pſalme</hi> (as he counteth) and elſe where often in his workes. And as for your ſpecial and particular enumeration of all ſinnes, and their circumſtances that poſſibly can be remembred, <hi>Beatus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus,</hi> a frend otherwiſe of yours, in his notes vpon <hi>Tertullians</hi> booke of repentance, reporteth, how that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the vexation and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſciences that that bread, one <hi>Geilerius</hi> a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> monke, wrote a booke, which he entituled <hi>de morbo confeſſionis,</hi> of the ſickneſſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, againſt the moroſity &amp; ſcrupuloſity, brought in by <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> and other ſchoolemen: of whoſe minde for that point, <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> ſheweth himſelfe to be. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a number of your Prieſts, by their fruites haue made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that of all other they would be loth that young women ſhould not come to auricular confeſſion vnto them, yet I can tell you, <hi>Baſil</hi> in his no queſtion thinketh it not very decent, that ſuch ſhould come alone, but rather aduiſeth that the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger by the graue elder women ſhould make their ſtate knowen, that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they may receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or direction what to doe: as they ſhall neede.</p>
                  <p>But yet, becauſe I would be loth to omit any thing either to cauſe you (Maſter <hi>Albine</hi>) to thinke that you haue ſaied or alleadged any thing of weight to iuſtifie this your kinde of confeſſion withall, or to cauſe the reader to ſuſpect, that theſe fathers, whoſe names you haue brought vs for this purpoſe, in theſe places, ſay more directlie for you, then they doe: let vs particulerly examine your quotations, alwaies remembring the ſtate of the queſtion, as it is in this point betwixt vs. Your firſt man is <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his fift ſermon <hi>de lapſis:</hi> wherein his purpoſe was to perſwade them, that had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grieuouſly fallen from Chriſtianity to idolatrie, or that had but a ſecret purpoſe for the ſafety of themſelues ſo to doe, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to repent thereof, in perſuit of which his purpoſe in the ende hee commeth to that (which it ſeemeth you ayme at) to note it as an argument of greater fayth and better feare in ſuch that will (though they haue but thought ſo to fall) yet ſorrowfully and playnelie confeſſe the ſame before the Lordes Prieſtes, and ſo making <hi>exoniologeſin,</hi> that is, publicke confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhew forth the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their minde, ſeeking holeſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e phiſicke, though,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18269:220"/> for their ſmall woundes in compariſon: and therefore a little after, he there earneſtly exhorteth euery ſuch offender, in purpoſe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, to confeſſe their fault therein whiles they be here, whiles their confeſſion and repentance may be acceptable with the Lorde. Which place ſerueth wel to proue, that then of ſuch notorious faults there was vſed and lookt for publicke and ſorrowfull confeſſion. But what is this to the enumeration of all ſinnes remembred in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the eare of a Prieſt? Sure I am, in that ſermon before he came to theſe wordes, contrary to your doctrine and practiſe in this very point, he teacheth, that <hi>veniam peccatis quae in ipſum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſa ſunt, ſolus poteſt ille largiri, qui peccata noſtra portauit &amp;c.</hi> that is, he onely can giue vs pardon for our ſinnes, that bore our ſinnes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adding ſtreight, <hi>man cannot be greater then God, neither can he being a ſeruant, by his indulgence, remit or forgiue that, which is grieuouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt God, leaſt ſo to him that is falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this fault come vnto his other, that he forget that it was ſaied lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ago Hier.</hi> 17. <hi>curſed is that man that hath his truſt in man.</hi> And therefore both immediatly and thorow that ſermon, he is earneſt to moue them that were fallen, to fly to God in prayer, in weeping, and mourning. Now indeede both for their better direction to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde effectually, and for the further declaration and teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their repentance to be vnfeyned, he would haue confeſſion of ſuch their falles to be made with all ſorrowfulnes before the Lords Prieſts. Let this doctrine therefore of his onely be receaued, and your auricular confeſſion will come ſhort home. For if none but ſuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue ſo fallen as he there ſpeakes of, ſhould confeſſe ſuch their falles: and that onely to that ende that he teacheth, without all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion when they haue done, that any can abſolue them but God, your confeſſours and ghoſtly fathers (as you tearme them) might be ſet a begging for any liuing they could get by hearing of confeſſions. The next you alleadge is <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the 37. Pſalme, and in his 2. <hi>Hom.</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> wherin indeede he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelleth thoſe that haue fallen into any greeuous ſinne, though ſecret, yet to ſeeke out ſome diſcreet and ſkilful Phiſition, to open their diſeaſe and diſtreſſe of minde vnto that according to his counſell and aduiſe they may doe: either in publickly confeſſing of them, or otherwiſe in repenting of them; and this is the moſt that can be made of any thing fated by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi> in theſe two places: but this his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel may bee followed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and yet you come very ſhort of prouing the neceſſity, by gods
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18269:220"/> law of your auricular confeſſion, or ſpeciall and preciſe enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the ſinnes and circumſtances thereof in the eare of a Prieſt. The phiſicke that they fought at the Prieſtes handes in theſe caſes, was direction how to repent, and to recouer comfort vnder the burden of their ſinnes, by the meanes of ſuch comfortable doctrine and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, that he ſhould giue them out of the booke of God: and the thing that you ſeeke for at their hands is abſolution, to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them vnto you for your ſo confeſſing. So that neither for matter to be confeſſed, nor for the ende thereof, haue you any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and countenance from them. After <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Auguſtines</hi> 2. booke <hi>de viſitatione infirmorum</hi> is produced, in which booke, the authour threatneth da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch as hauing ſinned, ſhunned the iudgement of men, &amp; yet tooke not occaſion, by the conſideration of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they could not ſhunne, to repent and amend: but if they iudged and amended themſelues, he doeth not ſo. <hi>Allen</hi> will not ſtand to it, that thoſe bookes were <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> writing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And <hi>Eraſmus</hi> cenſure therof was, that it is <hi>ſermo locutulei, nec docti, nec diſerti,</hi> that is, it is the ſpeech of ſome pratler, neither learned nor elequent: yea hee addeth what forehead or minde had they, that thruſt vpon vs, ſuch writings vnder the name of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> And the diuines of <hi>Louain</hi> ſay flatly, it was none of his, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with farre more credit to your cauſe might you haue let this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony alone, and neuer haue mentioned it. But whoſoeuer were the authour thereof, no more can be grounded thereupon, but that be thought it good, to further the repentance of the party, that hee ſhould confeſſe his ſinne, that he had fallen into and offended Gods Church withal, to the miniſter, that by him he might be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by correption, admonition, or conſolation, as he ſaw good. And the edge of his ſpeech is not ſimply againſt ſuch as did refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes to Gods miniſters, but onely againſt ſuch, as refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo to doe, did not repent, for he ſaieth <hi>ſi ea confiteri aut emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare noluerint,</hi> and againe, <hi>ſi in malo permanſerint,</hi> that is, if they will not confeſſe them, nor amend, and if they continue in euill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the words in the place quoted by you, be well marked, it wil therby ſufficiently appeare, in that there were then ſo many reaſons that ſtaied men (as there by that authours wordes, it ſeemeth there were) from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing to the prieſts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was not then thought, that ſo to confeſſe ſinnes, was ſo neceſſary as you would now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend yours to be. If it had beene either thought to be ſimply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18269:221"/> by Gods law, or it then had beene thought and knowen to be a ſet law of the Church, to confeſſe ſinnes in ſecret to the miniſters, why haue not you, nor yet any of your ſide, brought vs any ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer vſed either of theſe reaſons to perſwade men vnto it. <hi>Cyril</hi> in his 12. booke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Ioh. cap.</hi> 56. is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth man you cite for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which place if you had euer read, you ſhould haue found him to ſet down this firſt, as a moſt ſure principle, that only God is he, that muſt looſe a man from his ſinnes, <hi>for to whom elſe</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>ſhall it be lawfull to deliuer transgreſſours of the law, but vnto the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Lawe himſelfe?</hi> Which poſition if it were receaued, there would be ſmal haſt made to your eare ſhrift. But then indeede it followeth in him, <hi>how then did Chriſt giue this diuine power to his Apoſtles?</hi> Whereunto his anſwere is, <hi>that he gaue it them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gaue them the holy ghoſt, &amp; becauſe the holy ghoſt by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forgaue ſins:</hi> which he ſheweth the holy ghoſt did, by vſing their miniſtry, to baptiſe men and to bring them to repentance, by rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſinners, and by ſhewing them fauour againe, as <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with the man of <hi>Corinth.</hi> So that you ſee his doctrine is there, that men come to haue their ſins forgiuen them, by the holy ghoſts vſing our miniſtry effectually to bring men to repentance: where to make auricular confeſſion to men of all their ſinnes is not reckoned vp as anie meanes whereby in the Apoſtles, or by the Apoſtles, the holy ghoſt forgaue anie their ſinnes, but to preach the worde, to miniſter the Sacraments, and to vſe the cenſures of the Church, in due ſeaſon are noted to bee the meanes. Hee ſendeth vs there, you ſee, to the example of <hi>Pauls</hi> dealing with the man of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of whoſe repentance and receauing againe into Gods Church, and ſo to a liuelie hope of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes wee reade, but that either <hi>Paul</hi> or anie other miniſter had him before them to bring him to this, by auricular confeſſion, wee neither reade nor can beleeue, and therefore <hi>Cyril</hi> is rather quite againſt you, then any thing for you in this point, in that place. Now laſt of all, is <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon the tenth of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> where all that he ſaieth is this, <hi>if the Serpent the Deuill priuilie bite anie and infect him (none being priuy thereunto) with the poiſon of ſinne, if he that is ſtrucken holde his peace and repent not, nor will confeſſe his wounde to his brother or maſter, the maſter that hath a to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue to cure him, eaſily cannot profitte him:</hi> who of vs denie this, that hee that will neither ſpeake and repent, nor thus by confeſſion ſeeke
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18269:221"/> for better phyſicke at the hands of the ſpirituall phyſitian, then he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue himſelfe, cannot eaſily be profited by ſuch a phyſitian? Yea that more is, we ſay and holde, that hee that will neither repent betwixt God and himſelfe, nor yet ſeeke to thoſe to ſhew his eſtate, that are appointed to teach him how to repent, is in a moſt fearefull caſe. But yet againe we ſay, that they, that in ſuch ſecret ſinnes, whereof <hi>Hierom</hi> plainely ſpeaketh, will with <hi>Dauid acknowledge their ſinne vnto God, and not hyde their iniquitie. Pſalm.</hi> 32. <hi>but forſake it, they ſhall haue mercie, Prouerb.</hi> 28. though they neuer bewraie thoſe their ſinnes to anie Prieſt or miniſter. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath <hi>Hierom,</hi> nor any other of theſe fathers, in any of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſaied any thing to the contrarie. What are you therefore the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, for anie thing that they haue ſaied, to proue the neceſſity of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall and ſpeciall enumeration of all ſinnes that can bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the circumſtances thereof, in the eare of a Prieſt, though otherwiſe neuer ſo well confeſſed to God and repented of. Yea what haue any of them ſpoken in any of theſe places, either to proue the neceſſity or vniuerſality of your kinde of confeſſion, which are the thinges you ſhould haue proued by them, or elſe you proue nothing in queſtion, or to the purpoſe? For let confeſſion of ſinnes vnto them be free, as it was in their times, and in ſuch caſes, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot otherwiſe ſo well, get eaſe, remedy and comfort againſt their ſins, we are very well contented with them, to perſwade men, that it is a very good and profitable way for them, in ſickneſſe and in health, to confeſſe vnto ſome diſcreete miniſter or miniſters, what ſinnes they be that ſo trouble them, that ſo aduiſe by them, may be miniſtred vnto them accordingly. And this is the vtmoſt that any of theſe places can haue, ſo much as any ſhew to helpe you vnto: which is as farre from yours, as chalke is from cheeſe, you hauing made it, as you haue, a matter of abſolute neceſſity, and hauing ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it to ſuch a full ſpeciall recitall of all, and that by all perſons and ſexes at an appointed time of the yeare, as you haue alſo. But enough of this matter, now therefore let vs go on and ſee, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you haue anie better holde in the fathers, for the other two pointes behinde.</p>
                  <p>The next is, praying to Saints in paradiſe, to helpe vs with their prayers. For the which you alleadge onelie the names of foure, <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hierom:</hi> of which there is not one indeede, that in any of his vndoubted &amp; known
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18269:222"/> works to be his, that ſo much as mentioneth praying vnto them. For whereas you here haue quoted vs three places of <hi>Origen,</hi> for this your purpoſe, the two later, I cannot thinke were his. As for the laſt out of his 8. booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> there are no ſuch bookes fathered v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, either in any of his Tomes, that I euer yet could ſee, nor yet attributed vnto him by <hi>Tritenhemius,</hi> who reckoneth vp al that he was acquainted withall of his. And as for that, you alleadge out of his ſecond booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> I graunt whoſoeuer was authour of thoſe tractes, hee concludeth the ſecond tract with a groſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prayer to <hi>Iob.</hi> But certaine it is, thoſe tracts or bookes were neuer <hi>Origens,</hi> nor that prayer of his making or liking. My reaſons are theſe, firſt, the authour thereof ſheweth himſelfe an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> in the firſt tract, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath obſerued, that theſe of <hi>Iob,</hi> were neuer but in latin, whereas he wrote all his in Greek: and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he himſelfe (if that praier were his) ſhould be contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For againſt <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 8. (which bookes are his vndoubtedly) he anſwering the arguments of <hi>Celſus:</hi> that it cannot offend the high God, if the inferiour Gods (whom <hi>Celſus</hi> called <hi>daemones</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his frends, be worſhipped with inuocation, to prouoke them to ſollicite mens cauſes with the high God (which argument that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then wretch there cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth with the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Princes Courts, to ſollicite the Prince, by ſuch as are about him, euen for all the world, as you vſe to doe, your praying to Saints) telleth him, that one God is to bee praied vnto in the name of Chriſt Ieſus. And as for the Saints and Angels (ſaieth he) though they be Gods frends, yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is to be pleaſed: and pleaſe him, and then alſo yee pleaſe theſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 760. and 774. Now in the other place, which is the firſt you cite, na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ely out of his 3. <hi>Homily</hi> vpon the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticles,</hi> al that he ſaith, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring any whit for this your purpoſe, is this, that hee ſaieth, <hi>it is not inconuenient to ſay, they pray for vs:</hi> wherof likewiſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. vpon <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> he ſpeaketh doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſtammeringly, as one not fully reſolued that it was ſo, and therefore confidently to be aduouched and taught: which I thinke was the ſowing of ſome ſeede towards this opinion of yours. But who is ſo ſimple, but he may ſee, that though this were granted to be an vndoubted and certaine thing, that they pray for vs, yet thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it followeth not, that we here muſt, or may pray vnto them? And that <hi>Origen</hi> himſelfe neuer gathered ſo thereupon, it may appeare ſufficiently by his foreſaied anſwer to <hi>Celſus.</hi> But howſoeuer, it is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18269:222"/> knowen well enough, that <hi>Origen</hi> was not thought, of the ancient fathers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues an authour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> credit, that whatſoeuer he taught or thought, ought ſtreight to be receaued as true and ſound. For it appeares plainely in <hi>Epiphanius, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>haereſi</hi> 64. and in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that his opinion of him was, that he was not ſound in doctrine, and <hi>Hierom ad Oceanum</hi> ſaieth flatly of him thus, <hi>I haue prayſed Origen as an interpreter, but not as a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, his witte, not faith:</hi> and further he ſaieth of him, <hi>Beleeue mee that haue experience, his doctrines are poyſoned, diſagreeing from the ſcriptures, offring violence vnto them.</hi> And <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of <hi>Aegeſippus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. noteth, <hi>that vnto thoſe times</hi> (about which he began to floriſh) <hi>the Church remained a pure and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Virgin, but then errours as though they had conſpired ſo to doe, burſt into the Church, as into an empty houſe, with naked and bare face and head.</hi> But yet for any thing that either you haue noted out of <hi>Origen,</hi> or that I can eſpy elſewhere in any of his vndoubted writings, for this matter, he can be charged no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for ſetting abroach and a foote this queſtion, <hi>whither the Saints praied for vs or no?</hi> Whereupon ſhortly after, and by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſundry miracles were done, men praying vnto God by the tombes of martyrs, it began more ſtrongly to be thought, that the ſoules of ſuch in heauen, did much with God for men here in earth, in ſo much that thereupon it grew to be an vſe, to go vnto martyrs in priſon, to requeſt their praiers, when they were departed to God. So that by <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, which was not long after, theſe thinges began, for he died <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 249. (as it appeareth in his <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>epiſt. epiſt.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 1.) it was taken for ſo reſolute a trueth of him, that they could and would remember their olde frends here, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he in theſe places vſe there exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the faithfull brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, that in any eaſe they would remember out another, when anie of them were dead. But yet for all this, finde I not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in any of theſe times, or long after, any teacher allowed and of credit in Gods Church, was ſo bold, as therefore either to pray vnto them when they were dead, or to teach others ſo to doe. And yet you confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently here further ſend vs to <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> 8. homily vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to <hi>Auguſtines</hi> to booke <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 21. againſt <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> (you ſay, but you ſhould haue ſaied <hi>Fauſtus</hi>) and to <hi>S. Hier.</hi> againſt <hi>Vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius,</hi> there to read, prayer vnto them, by them taught and iuſtified. I wonder that you were not aſhamed thus ſhamefully
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18269:223"/> firſt to bee abuſed your ſelfe, and then thus to ſeeke to abuſe your Reader. For let him reade, and reade againe and againe, all theſe places, and I aſſure him he ſhall not finde one worde or ſillable vttered in any of them in the allowance of praying vnto them. In the firſt place, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> according to his maner, doeth ſollace himſelfe much about <hi>Paules</hi> cheine and impriſonment, but not a worde is there vttered by him of praying, either vnto <hi>Paul</hi> or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Saint, nor yet of their praying for vs. And in <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> twenty one Chapter of his twenty booke againſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> (if you had taken the paines to reade the Chapter) you ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue found no mention at all there of praying vnto them, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much there ſet downe by him directly againſt your faſhions in honouring of them. For there firſt, <hi>he flatly condemneth as idolatrous, dedicating altars vnto them, offering ſacrifices vnto them, and their ſhrines, and worſhipping of them with any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour, &amp; ſheweth that ſuch as any of theſe waies honour them, are either by ſound doctrine reproued, that ſo they maie ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned:</hi> which are moſt notoriouſly practiſed by you, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating Churches and Chappels vnto them, calling them by their names, in running a pilgrimage not onelie to their reliques, but to their pictures, and there offering before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what you thinke good, and moſt groſſely in praying vnto them, which if it bee not a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point of diuine honour, nothing can bee. And then he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what honour it is, that is to be giuen them and no other, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the honour of loue and ſociety, as wee honour therewith, holy men here aliue (though then, therewith ſo much the more deuoutly, as their ſtate is more bleſſed) and the keeping of their memories (to prouoke the better others to imitate them) with religious ſolemnity:</hi> and elſe where hee ſeemeth to like verie well that they ſhould bee honourably both thought of and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, that they ought decently to bee buried, and haue their tombes and ſepulchers kept and preſerued, and that it was lawfull thereby, to pray vnto God for ſuch things as were lawfull, &amp; that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtood is neede of: and laſtly, the furtheſt that euer he went either in this place or any where elſe was this, <hi>that hee thought ſome good came by their praiers, to ſuch as thus honoured them, or rather GOD in them.</hi> And further then thus neuer went <hi>Hierom</hi> againſt <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius.</hi> So that all this while, we cannot finde ſo much as praying vnto Saints, either in <hi>Origen</hi> indeede, or in <hi>Chryſoſt, Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:18269:223"/> or <hi>Hierom,</hi> once mentioned in theſe places you quote: that they pray for vs, and that their prayers may doe vs ſome good, is the moſt wee finde in any of them: which though it were graunted you, yet thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it followeth not, that we are to pray to them, as I haue ſaied. For if that be a part of their duety, by God looked for at their hands, ſuch is their ſtate of perfection there, that we may bee ſure that they neede not (as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here ſubiect vnto infirmities doe) by vs to be put in remembrance of their duetie. And againe, ſeeing wee haue neither commaundement in Gods booke to direct vs, example to leade vs, nor promiſe to encourage vs to praie vnto them there, eſpecially prayer beeing, as it is, a ſpeciall ſpirituall worſhip, for the making whereof vnto God onely in his worde, wee haue all theſe three, whatſoeuer they doe or can doe for vs, wee dare not without warrant from God, yea contrary to the direction that we haue from him in this point, take this honour of praying to him alone, from him, to giue it to them. Yea wee cannot but ſee, theſe thinges conſidered, that if wee ſhould, therein wee ſhould neither honour them nor GOD aright, and that in very deede our doing ſo, could not be obedience to GOD, but diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not proceede of faith, but rather of lacke of faith in him, and ſo would be both a diſhonour of GOD, and then alſo indeede wee finde, that GOD hath ſaied vnto vs flatly, <hi>Call vpon mee in the daie of trouble, ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie mee. Pſalme</hi> 50. <hi>And that hee is a Lorde ſo iealous of his owne glorie, that hee will not giue it to another,</hi> he hath plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught vs, <hi>Eſaie</hi> 42. And therefore ſeeing Chriſt (of whom when he ſhould come, the very woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> had learned, <hi>that hee ſhould teach vs all things. Iohn.</hi> 4.) teaching his Diſciples to praie (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.) hath taught them no otherwiſe to praie, but to him, to whom when they prayed, they might firſt ſay, <hi>Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in heauen,</hi> &amp; then concluding their praies, adde, <hi>for thine is the kingdome, the power and the glory, for euer &amp; euer:</hi> we being ſure, that without blaſphemy we can neither beginne nor end our praiers thus, we dare not direct our praiers to any Saint or Angell, but onely to God. We are ſure he is able both to heare our prayers, and to graunt our requeſtes, becauſe hee is almighty: and that hee is willing ſo to doe, wee haue aſſurance, <hi>as long as wee aske according to his vvill:</hi> the firſt of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the fift, <hi>becauſe he is mercifull and true, and faithfull in all his promiſes.</hi>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:18269:224"/> And therefore we thinke it is a ſure way, to run to him, and to truſt to him, in all our needes and neceſſities. If we would haue an aduocate either of mediation or interceſſion vnto him, wee haue one for all, euen Ieſus our Lord and ſauiour. For as <hi>Paul</hi> firſt teacheth vs, <hi>ther is but one God,</hi> ſo likewiſe in the ſame verſe he aſſureth vs, <hi>there is but one mediatour betweene God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and <hi>Iohn</hi> ioyning with him in his firſt epiſtle &amp; ſecond Chapter, <hi>pointeth him only vnto vs to be our aduocate with the father.</hi> And he being <hi>the</hi>

If wee ſhould leaue him at all, one ſo able and willing euery way to ſerue our turn alone, to run vnto any Saint or Angel of his. And therfore as we dare make our praiers to none but vnto God, ſo dare we vſe no other mediatour or aduocate vnto him, but onely Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and ſauiour. We are ſure it ſauoureth ſtrongly of lack of faith in vs in him, if not of flat Antichriſtian blaſphemie, once but to imagine, that any be Saint or ſhe Saint in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or Angell, wil be readier to take compaſſion of vs, or that we may be bolder to vſe any of their interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his. For in al things he became like vnto vs his brethren, that he might be merciful, and a faithfull high Prieſt in things concerning God, that he might make reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſinnes of the people, for in that he ſuffered and was tempted, he is able to ſuccour them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.18. For we haue not a high Prieſt which cannot bee touched, with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things in like ſort tempted, yet without ſinne, let vs therefore go boldely vnto the throne of grace, that wee
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18269:224"/> may receaue mercy and finde grace (through him) in time of neede, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.16. And let vs take heede in this caſe, whiles we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your example, in leauing him and running to Saints, to pray for vs, we commit not the two euills, that the prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> withal, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. that is, <hi>forſake the liuing fountaine a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of liuing waters, to dig vnto our ſelues pits, euen broken pits that will hold no water.</hi> For as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaieth in reſpect of theſe two faults, <hi>O yee heauens be aſtonied at this, &amp; bee affraide &amp; confounded (ſaieth the Lord)</hi> ſo worthily may we ſay in reſpect of this your folly and double ſinne in this point. For though to leſſen ſomewhat your ſinne herein, you would ſeeme to plead onely for praying vnto the Saints in paradiſe to helpe you with their prayers; that nothing indeede can help you. For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for theſe reaſons is euen that abhominable and vnlawful, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that you in your practiſe (as I haue ſhewed at large in my anſwere to your publiſhers preface) moſt groſſely and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly, pray vnto the Saints themſelues, thorough their merits to procure you the thinges you ſue for. Yea you are gone ſo farre, that according to the multitude of your neceſſities, the varietie of occupations, and the diſtinctions of regions and cuntries, you haue appointed the Saints to their ſeuerall offices and limits, therein i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating the idolatrous heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who imagining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were many Gods, thought it good to know euery one of their offices, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they might vſe them, as <hi>Auguſt: de ciuitate Dei, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. noteth.

For it is to giue that honour that is due vnto the Prince vnto his Nobles, thus to leaue the creatour, to adore the creature: and then further anſwering you, that your reaſon holdeth not from Princes Courts on earth to Gods in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>For they are men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp; therfore to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men muſt ſo come, becauſe otherwiſe they know not whom to truſt, but with God that knoweth al things, to win his fauour, Suffragatore non eſt opus, ſed mente deuotâ,</hi> there is no neede of one to ſpeake for vs, but of a deuout mind.

Theſe arguments of his had not beene good, neither would hee euer haue

I know ſome of you, finding the Scriptures and fathers thus directlie to condemne adoration of the Saints (though they maintaine ſtill all your practiſe of praying vnto them) yet haue not beene aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to write (as it appeares in the cenſure of <hi>Colen</hi> printed there one thouſand fiue hundreth ſixty) that amongſt you it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much as heard, that the Saints are to be adored, for adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due onely to God. Whereas they could not bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that their legends, roſaries, and other their bookes of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, publique and priuate, are full both of the name and thing: did they not knowe that the whole pſalter is turned to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that therein it is writen <hi>venite adoremus eam,</hi> come let vs adore her? Howſoeuer they knew this or no, they could not forget their olde ſaying of the Croſſe, <hi>beholde the woode of the Croſſe whereon the ſaluation of the world hanged, venite adoremus,</hi> come let vs adore it. If theſe will not ſerue to make them better to remember them ſelues, let them reade their owne <hi>Antonin. part.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and they ſhall finde him, in plaine wordes to tell them, <hi>that the Saints, by the Pope, by his canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of them, are ſet forth vnto men, not onely as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faith and holy life, but alſo abomnibus adorandi &amp; in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitatibus inuocandi,</hi> that is, of all to be adored, and in neceſſities to be prayed vnto. <hi>Wherein to ſay</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>that the Pope er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red were hereticall.</hi> But this is like your other common ſhifts, when you ſay you vſe the Saints but as Mediatours of interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not of ſaluation, which onely belongs to Chriſt; and that you: doe not giue them <hi>Latreian,</hi> but <hi>Douleian,</hi> that is, as you expound the words, not diuine honour, but an inferiour honour, not aſking at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that they ſhould either giue you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good things you would haue, or keepe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you the euil, that you would not haue, the falſhood and vanity whereof I haue both in my anſwere to the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:18269:227"/> preface of your booke, and alſo ſomewhat in this Chapter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bewrayed. For let any man read ouer &amp; conſider your praiers and practiſe, and he ſhall finde that you make them mediatours of ſaluation, and not onely of interceſſion, though that onely if you did (it being as it is, a ſpecial part of the office of Chriſts mediatorſhip, to be the very altar whereupon, and whereby we muſt acceptably, preſent theſe our ſpirituall ſacrifices vnto his heauenly father, hee being, as he is, of himſelfe alone thorowly both able &amp; willing fully to execute his owne office) you could not excuſe &amp; cleare your ſelues, of being guilty of high treaſon againſt Chriſt. And he ſhould further finde, that you giue the diuineſt honour that may bee, &amp; that you doe directly beg all things euen at their hands, that you can beg at Gods. For it is vſual with you to ſing to <hi>Mary: ſalua eos quite glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that glorify thee, that ſuccour the miſerable, help the weake, refreſh them that mourne:</hi> &amp; you ſay to her, <hi>Mary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grace, mother of mercy, protect vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemy, receiue vs at the hour of death:</hi> &amp; in the pſalter now turned &amp; put forth by the deuout ſeruant of hers <hi>Bonauenture</hi> (as ſome thinke) you ſticke not to vſe all thoſe ſpeeches to her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the pſalmes are vſed to God himſelfe, and therefore you bluſh not to ſay vnto her. <hi>Haue mercie vpon me O Lady, according to thy great mercy, &amp; according to the multitude of thy mercies blot out my iniquities.</hi> But not onely thus haue you doubted about <hi>Mary,</hi> but quite contrarie to your owne wordes, when you would vſe theſe ſhifts, you deale with other Saints. For you praie to <hi>Baſil, that he would looke downe vpon you from aboue, &amp; change your whole life, and you praie Athanaſius to direct the holy people,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Cyprian to direct both your ſpeech and life,</hi> and who ſo readeth your <hi>ſpeculum exemplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim,</hi> your glaſſe of examples, he ſhall finde there, and in ſuch other bookes of yours, ſuch ſtories tolde of things done by this Saint and that, for ſuch as worſhipped them, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereby it may moſt clearely appeare, that you haue no ſtay nor moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all, whatſoeuer you ſay, in praying to them.</p>
                  <p>Thus then thou maieſt ſee (Chriſtian Reader) for all <hi>M. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> ſending of thee to reade <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> for the maintenance of his praying to the Saints in Paradiſe, that not onely they haue quite forſaken him therein, but that alſo both Scripture, they and a number of ancient fathers beſides, haue condemned that their praying vnto Saints, for groſſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18269:228"/> idolatry. The moſt (thou ſeeſt) that any of the fathers quoted by him for this, haue ſaied, that hath any ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, is, that they thought it was not inconuenient to thinke, that the Saints in heauen, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Saints aliue yet vpon the earth, and that therby they did them ſome good: which, as I haue ſhewed thee, by good reaſons, proueth not, that therefore they are to be praied vnto thus of vs. But to conclude this matter, euen touching this point, I would haue thee to vnderſtand, that the firſt brochers hereof, &amp; they of the ancient fathers, that moſt ſeemed to bee reſolued of it, yet ſpake thereof, but ſtammeringly and doubtfully. For thou haſt heard <hi>Origen</hi> onely ſay, that he thought <hi>it was not inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to think ſo,</hi> and vpon the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> moouing that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>whether the ſoules of the Saints departed, doe any thing, and labour for vs, as the Angels doe, or no?</hi> he in concluſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth, <hi>that if they doe, that yet it is amongſt Gods ſecretes, and that it is a myſtery not to be committed to paper.</hi> And <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, de curâ agendâ pro mortuis,</hi> inclines to the negatiue, and therefore to that end alleadgeth, that <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63. <hi>Abraham knoweth vs not, and Iſrael hath forgot vs.</hi> And though <hi>Nazianzene</hi> ſeeme with <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> to think <hi>they doe pray for vs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs good,</hi> yet where he ſhewes himſelfe to be moſt of that mind, as in his oration of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and in his epitaph of his father, he vttereth it not as a reſolute trueth, whereof he was ſure, but aduouching it, addeth, <hi>as I think, if I be not deceaued, or if it be not too much to ſay ſo:</hi> which argueth, that he was not perſwaded and reſolued, that it was a plaine trueth taught in the worde, but that onelie it was thought to bee a thing probable and poſſible: and therefore this muſt needes be a weake ground to build ſo maſſy and huge a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon, as the popiſh praying to Saints co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to. To conclude therefore this point, in this caſe notably hath <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaied, <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queſtion is of a thing moſt obſcure, the certaine and plaine inſtructions of the diuine authority not helping vs to decide the matter, let mans preſumption ſtay it ſelfe, doing nothing by inclining rather to the one ſide, then another. De pec. meritis lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. And againe, ſeeing it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they haue no ground for it in ſcripture (which ſome of the beſt of themſelues confeſſe) with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> let vs ſay both of this and that which they would builde thereon, <hi>of Chriſt, or of his Church, or of any thing elſe which apperteineth to faith or life, if we,</hi> but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaied, <hi>if an
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18269:228"/> Angell from heauen ſhould preach vnto you, beſide that which yee haue receiued, in the ſcriptures of the law &amp; the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, let him be accurſed: contra literas Petil. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. And ſo vpon theſe premiſſes boldly let vs conclude, and ſay with him, <hi>Non ſit nobis religio cultus hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortuoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: de verâ religione cap.</hi> 55. <hi>let it bee no part of our religion to worſhip dead men.</hi> For as he there addeth. <hi>If they liued godly indeed, they are not now in that minde, that they would haue ſuch honours giuen them of vs, but God they would haue vs worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are come to the laſt point of your 4, which is praying for the dead: for the which you wil vs to read two places in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> one in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> two in <hi>Origen,</hi> one in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and three in <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> which at your requeſt I hauing done (though I muſt needes confeſſe, this your errour in ſome of theſe hath more counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and allowance giuen it then the former had) yet I hope by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, you ſhal haue as little cauſe to brag that all theſe Doctours teach you your kinde of praying for the dead, as any of the former things, that you haue alleadged any of them for: for ſome of theſe your authours in theſe places you quote, doe not ſo much as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which, becauſe it is the thing whereby both you are abuſed, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moſt fondly &amp; yet abſurdly, in this caſe you alwaies ſeeke to abuſe your poore ſimple reader, before I proceede any further to examine your quotations, I muſt labour ſomewhat to acquaint him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

                     </hi> or ſome other father ſpeaks of ſome purging paine after this life, <hi>ergo</hi> of the popiſh purgatorie. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh vnconſtantly or very doubtfully of a purging paine or place after this life, <hi>ergo</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:18269:229"/> queſtionles there is ſuch a third place as the papiſts imagin, &amp; ſuch purging there is as they teach. And there is ſuch a place, <hi>ergo</hi> they that be there muſt and can be relieued there by the praiers of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: or in ſome ſort the dead are to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred in our praiers, <hi>ergo</hi> they in that place, therby to be releiued.

And to begin w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Origen,</hi> both becauſe hee was the ancienter, &amp; becauſe hee was firſt named, in the very ſecond place here quoted by <hi>Albin,</hi> he ſpeaketh of purging in the fire of hel, and in the other of purging in ſuch fire, as will conſume in them that hold the foundation, their wood, hay, &amp; ſtubble, that they built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that ſo when their ſoules depart from their bodies, they maie go to heauen, which with thoſe vnconſumed they cannot: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire he ſaieth is God. For his words in the latter place are theſe. <hi>He that deſpiſeth the purifications of the word of God, and doctrine of the goſpel, reſerueth himſelfe to ſorowful &amp; paineful purifications, that the fire of hel in torments may purge him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither the Apoſtles doctrine, nor word of the goſpell hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> And in the other (preaching I am ſure they wil graunt to men aliue and not to the dead (his words (the better to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looke whiles they were aliue that they caried no wood, hay, nor ſtubble w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnconſumed) be theſe: <hi>if after Chriſt the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou buildeſt thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not gold, ſiluer, &amp; pretious ſtones only in the minde (if thou haſt any ſuch) but alſo hay, wood &amp; ſtubble, what wouldeſt thou be done with thee, when thy ſoule ſhal be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body?

Now who ſeeth not by this, that the purging place that he ſpeakes of in the ſecond place is hell it ſelfe, and that the other is in this life, whiles Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warned in time, whiles they are here, doe let the fire of Gods ſpirite both reueale vnto them, and conſume in them all their vnſuteable building to the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whither it be in religion or maners? what places then were theſe (vnles the papiſtes bee growen now to be of opinion, that the partition wall betwixt hell and their purgatory is quite pulled downe, and al become verie hell, or elſe that their purgatorie is in this life) to alleadge either for purgatory or praiers for the deade? Further touching <hi>Origens</hi> fanſies about purging after this life, <hi>Auguſt. de ciuitate Dei, l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 17. ſaith, <hi>that the very diuell &amp; his angels after certaine grieuous and long laſting puniſhments, ſhal be freed and deliuered from thoſe torments and ioyned againe in ſociety with the holy Angels,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> beleeued. And vpon <hi>Luke</hi> hom. 14. <hi>Origen</hi> himſelfe ſaieth, <hi>I think after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, we al ſhal ſtand neede of a ſacrament to cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe and purge vs: for none can ariſe againe without his defilings.</hi> And vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 36. <hi>Pſ.</hi> hom. 3. he writeth <hi>that he thought, that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that all ſhould come into the purging fire, though hee were Paul or Peter:</hi> and of the ſame mind he ſeemeth to be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Num.</hi> hom. 25. which if you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of any purging fire of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of the inward effectuall operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fier of Gods ſpirit, to lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to purge &amp; conſume our darke, ſinfull and erronious harts (for ſo ſometime hee and others of the ancient writers ſpeake) then theſe places make nothing for your purgatory, which is after this life: if otherwiſe you vnderſtand him of ſome fire to purge after this life, ſo neither is he anie procter for your purgatory, to the which you ſende onely the middle ſort, neither very good nor very bad. A man therefore may wel think, that you are neere driuen for proofes for your purgatorie or prayer for the dead, when you run to theſe, or anie ſuch places in <hi>Origen,</hi> that ſpeaketh thereof ſo varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and not onelie farre from your ſence, but ſometimes euen in your owne iudgement, aſwel as in ours, very heretically. Now
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18269:230"/> as for <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> if what he hath writen of purgatory be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, your arguments from him will proue as weake, as from <hi>Origen.</hi> For whereas ſome of you alleadge him vpon the 103. <hi>Pſal. ſerm.</hi> 3. for purgatory, it is plaine, that he there ſpeaketh of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by fire, which he ſuppoſed would be in the end of the world, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſhould be on fire, and the good ſeparated from the bad, which fancy he rather chuſed to fall into, then to holde with <hi>Origen,</hi> that there is any purging in hell. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> moſt commonly vnderſtandeth that place of <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>of the fire of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and affliction, wkereby men are tried and purged,</hi> as he proueth out of the ſcripture, <hi>in this life, as golde in the fornace.</hi> And as for a meane place of purging any betwixt death &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he writeth ſometimes confidently that there is none ſuch, and ſometimes he leaueth it in doubt. For in his fifth booke <hi>Hypognoſt:</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> he acknowledgeth <hi>heauen to bee the place for the godly, and hel-fire for the wicked, but a third place,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>we are altogither ignorant of, neither doe we finde any in the holy ſcriptures.</hi> In like ſort <hi>de verbis Apoſtoli, ſer.</hi> 14. he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth theſe two againe, but a middle place hee vtterlie denieth, becauſe there is no mention thereof in the goſpell. I know it is anſwered, that when he ſaieth thus, hee ſetteth himſelfe againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> third place, which they aſſigned for infants dying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſed. But then yet I reply and ſay, if hee had beene reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the popiſh third place purgatorie, hee would and ſhould haue ſaied, there was no fourth place and not no third, if to this it bee reioyned, as I know it is by ſome, that he diſputed not there whither there were any more places then two before the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but whither there were any more then two euerlaſting recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, after that iudgement alſo to continue, and that in that ſence onely, he was reſolute there was but two: how then will they ſhift y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of his <hi>de ciuitate Dei. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. where deuiding all that die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good and bad, immediately vpon their death, he ſaieth, <hi>that the ſoules of the Godly ſeparated from their bodies are in reſt, and the ſoules of the other are in paines, whiles the bodies of thoſe riſe againe to euerlaſting life, and the others to euerlaſting paine which is the ſecond death.</hi> For here they cannot deny he ſpeaketh of the time &amp; ſtate of ſoules before the laſt iudgement: and yet here he findeth no third ſort or place for them in the meane time, no more then in the other.</p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:18269:230"/>
                  <p>But he was not very conſtant herein. For in his 21, booke of the City of God, <hi>cap,</hi> 26. he ſaieth, <hi>if in this meane time, betwixt death &amp; the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the ſouls of the departed be ſaied to ſuffer ſuch a fire, or there onely, or there and here, or therefore here and not there, a fire</hi> (he ſaieth) <hi>of tranſitory tribulation burning vp their worldly ſmaller faultes, I reproue it not, becauſe perhaps it is true.</hi> &amp; <hi>de fide &amp; operibus cap.</hi> 14. hee ſaieth likewiſe, <hi>whither in this life onely, men ſuffer theſe thinges, or after this life ſuch iudgements doe follow them</hi> (as I thinke) ſaieth he, <hi>this ſence of Paul is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the trueth, namely to vnderſtand him of the fire of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or triall.</hi> And in his <hi>Enchiridion cap.</hi> 68. he ſaieth, <hi>that the fire that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>is the fire of tribulation, through which both kinde of builders, there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, muſt paſſe: and tha ſuch a thing may be after this life, it is not incredible &amp; whither it be ſo or no, it may be a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. cap.</hi> 69. The like he hath of the 8, queſtions of <hi>Dulcitius,</hi> in his anſwere to the firſt of them: wherein it appeareth that he was very vncertaine, whither there were or no any ſuch fire of tribulation, after this life any where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt iudgement, to purge men of ſome kinde of ſinnes: but what theſe ſinnes were, that ſtaied men from going to heauen ſtraight vpon their death, whereof after they might get ſome releife and eaſe, he ſaieth, <hi>it was harde to finde, and perillous to define,</hi> and as for his owne part he confeſſeth, <hi>that though to that time he had laboured to finde out what they were, yet he could not, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>de ciuit: Dei, Cap.</hi> 27. And how dangerous it was and is, to fall into ſuch doubts, we may ſee in him. For in the 24 Chapter of the ſame booke, it appeareth, that vpon this ſuppoſition, that there might bee ſome ſuch purging fire, as he ſomtimes doubted of, he moueth this ſound queſtion: <hi>whither they ſhall bee ſaued, whom the daie of iudgement ſhall finde vnpurged with this fire, which yet might haue beene purged with it, if it had not come ſo ſoone?</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth that with an other doubtful imagination, <hi>that they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for a time ſome pains ſhal haue mercy, as he thought, &amp; not be condemned to hel,</hi> and in this ſaied 20 booke of the City of God he hath an opinion <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>that in the laſt iudgement before ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence bee pronounced, ſome ſhall paſſe thorow purging paines.</hi> And yet in the third queſtion to <hi>Dulcitius</hi> he determineth it as a flat trueth to be beleeued, <hi>that in the laſt iudgement there ſhall be no delay, but immediatly vpon the ſecond comming of Chriſt it

Hereby we ſee how wattering and inconſtant, euen famous learned men become, when they once wander without the light of the word, after the diſcourſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of the wit of man. How much better had it bene for <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> in theſe queſtions to remember the rule, and to haue followed that which he gaue others in ſuch caſes (as I ſhewed before in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſion of the former point out of his ſecond booke <hi>de pecca: meritis &amp; remiſſ. Cap.</hi> 36. Yet in none of theſe places or elſe where can I finde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he once dreamed of ſuch a purgatory fire as the papiſts teach, which ſhould be materiall, and of the ſame nature that the fire of hell is, ſaue onely that it is not eternal as that. Wherefore I conclude of him as of <hi>Origen,</hi> theſe things conſidered, the arguments are like to be very doughty and ſtrong, that are brought from any mention that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh of purgation after this life, either to proue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh purgatory or praier to relieue the ſoules of them that bee there. And euen as I haue ſaied of theſe two, ſo might I likewiſe of moſt of the ancient fathers, from whence they would ſeeme at any time to fetch countenance for this their purpoſe, they are ſo variable waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and inconſtant in their ſpeeches, moſt of them about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but this I hope is and will be ſufficient to proue the weakeneſſe of <hi>Albins</hi> arguments from theſe two, to iuſtifie his praying for the dead, becauſe theſe two in ſome of the places quoted by him (when he can get them to come no nearer the point) haue in ſome ſort ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of purging of men after this life in paines.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore likewiſe, I am to ſhew how weake there argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome mention found, in ſome of the fathers, of ſome kinde of remembring the dead in praiers. Which eaſily may be conceiued, if we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that firſt there may be an honourable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are dead in the Lord, without any praying for them at al: to ſhew our thankefulnes to God for the good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple they left vs, both of liuing holily, &amp; dying Chriſtianly, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prouoke others, by ſo reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to imitate their good ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample: and laſtly ſo to nouriſh in our ſelues, the hope of a ioiful reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to teſtifie our loue and Chriſtian affection towardes them ſo departed: which queſtionles was all that was done a long time, at the keeping of the memories of their deathes, or at anie time elſe, and of this very well may both <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> be vnderſtoode, in the places here quoted by <hi>Albin,</hi> as I will ſhewe anon. From ſuch a faſhion of mentioning the deade in our prayers,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18269:233"/> euery ſimple man may ſee, popiſh praying for them hath no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at all. Secondly, we ought to be aduertiſed, that foraſmuch as they that are dead in the Lord, haue not yet their conſummation, nor ſhall not, before the laſt day, that in that reſpect alſo, for ſuch (of whom we fully are perſwaded that they ſo died, that they haue their part in the promiſſe thereof) praiers may be made by the godly aliue very lawfully. And therefore thus we graunt the ancient fathers might pray for the dead: and thus we our ſelues (as appeareth here in <hi>England</hi> by the forme of praiers appointed to be vſed at the buriall of the dead, refuſe not to pray; that we with thoſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſiſters of ours, that depart hence in the Lord, may haue our perfect conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and bliſſe, at the laſt day, in the generall reſurrection. And yet of praiers thus made, for ſuch onely, by them or vs, neither popiſh praying for the dead, nor purgatory haue any ground. Laſtly it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that many of the ancient fathers of abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of loue towards their frendes departed, whoſe ſoules they were fully perſwaded were in reſt, and in ioy and felicity with the Lord in heauen (as they ſhew euen in the very places when their praiers for them are ſet downe) prayed yet vnto God for them. Thus praied <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> for his brother <hi>Caeſarius, oratione ſeptima, Ambroſe</hi> for <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentian. de obitu Valentiniani.</hi> And for <hi>Theodoſius. de obitu e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius.</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for his mother <hi>lib. confeſſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. Yea (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> reports in his ſtory) thus <hi>Charles</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great about 800. years after Chriſt, wrote to one <hi>Offa</hi> king here of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi> to deſire him that praiers might bee made for Pope <hi>Adrian, nullam habe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes dubitationem beata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illius animam eſſe in requie, ſed vt fidem &amp; dilectionem oſtendamus in amicum nobis chariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum:</hi> not doubting (ſaieth he) but that his bleſſed ſoule is in reſt, but to declare our faith, and loue towardes our moſt deare frend. Wherein they did, as if a tender tutor ouer his pupill, though hee knowe the childes parentes of themſelues will more carefully and tenderly looke to their childe, comming home vnto them from the vniuerſity, then euer hee, did or coulde, yet writing vnto them, to ſhewe his loue towardes his ſcholler, ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to vſe him louinglie and kindely. Howſoeuer it cannot be denyed, but that this was ſomewhat more then needed, and was ſome occaſion of further proceeding, from ſtep, to ſtep, vntill there were too too playne groundes layed of popiſh kinde of praying for the dead, yet euery man moſt eaſily may eſpie
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18269:234"/> that this kinde of praying for the dead, can neuer kindle, either the fire of popiſh purgatory, or iuſtifie their kinde of praying to relieue ſoules there. Indeed it ſhould ſeeme by <hi>Aerius</hi> his oppoſing himſelfe againſt praying for the dead, as it appeareth in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hee did, ſome by that time, miſtaking theſe kindes of praying for them, that I haue ſpoken of, and ſtretching the examples thereof further, then they ſhould (at leaſt as <hi>Aerius</hi> vnderſtood them) tooke vpon them ſo to pray for the dead, that howſoeuer a man liued and died, yet after he was gone by the prayers of his frendes, it was thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould doe wel inough. Againſt which kinde of praying for them, he inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as againſt the bane of all godlineſſe and religion, but herein by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> it appeareth he faulted, that this being but either the opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of the ignorant multitude, or his owne onely miſconſtruing the Churches faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in remembring of the dead in their praiers or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, he ſlanderouſly laied that to the charge of the Church. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> therefore in anſwering of him, laieth this downe for the ground of all the reſt, <hi>that thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church praied for, were with the Lord in reſt and ioie:</hi> which flatly ſheweth, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches praying for the dead, that he pleads for againſt <hi>Aerius,</hi> maketh nothing for the popiſh praying for them, or for purgatory. But vpon this occaſion, <hi>AErius</hi> vrging this queſtion, whither the praiers of men aliue did profit the dead, and if they did, whither ſo far, as that thereby they were deliuered from al their ſinnes, thereunto <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (both belike quite to condemne the opinion of the ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, &amp; yet loth alſo to defend that which he could not iuſtifie) firſt anſwereth onely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the praiers made for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were profitable; &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet not ſo profitable, as that therby al their ſinnes were done away: but neither doeth he ſimply and plainely anſwere, that they were profitable to the dead themſelues, nor once take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to aduouch, that thereby ſome certaine ſinnes, may be put away: but ſubtlely lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe things thus in ſuſpenſe, he flyeth to other cauſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they are profitable. And the cauſes and reaſons ſet downe by him are theſe: <hi>firſt, thereby comfortably their frends aliue are occaſioned, to beleeue that they that are dead are not periſhed, but aliue with the Lord: ſecondly, that thereby may be nouriſhed in the that liue, this hope, that the ſoules of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſo dead, are as pilgrimes gone out of their bodies to be with the Lord: and thirdly, that by praying ſo, euen for the beſt, as for patriarches, prophets, Apoſtles, and martyrs, it may bee acknowledged that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18269:234"/> the beſt were offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, that ſo Chriſt alone may haue that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence to be a man without ſinne, that ſo all may ſee, what neede they haue of Chriſt.</hi> The very like reaſons to theſe, are yeelded by him that beareth the name of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Ariopagite,</hi> of the ſolemne prayers and ſolemnities remembred by him at the buriall of the dead, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Eccleſ. Hierarchiae:</hi> where, of them that die, he maketh but <hi>two ſortes, holy and prophane,</hi> placing <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company all of them, aſwell the imperfecter ſort, as the moſt perfect, in bleſſed ſtate in their ſoules, immediately vpon their deathes: and the other in woe and eternall miſery.</hi> And yet, he alloweth, not onely, for the former ſort thankeſgiuing, but alſo prayers to be made vnto God, that for Chriſts ſake, their ſinnes may be forgiuen them, for the comfort and commonifaction of them that are aliue, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did. So that though in this caſe it be vſuall with the Papiſts, to make great bragges of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> and this <hi>Demus,</hi> yet if they bee thorowly looked into, they are more againſt them, then with them. The like may be ſaied of the reſt of the auncient fathers, whom they moſt make ſhewe of, in this point: for howſoeuer ſome of them, maie ſeeme to come ſomewhat too neare them, in ſeeming in ſome ſort to imagine, that ſome good may growe to the departed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſing of them, of ſome of their ſinnes, by the prayers of the faithfull for them, after they be gone hence (as it cannot bee denied, but that <hi>Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine</hi> and ſome others haue thought) yet that they either placed all, that they prayed for to haue any of their ſinnes forgiuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in purgatorie, or that they thought that ſoules ſo tormented there for ſinnes vnſatiſfied for here, might thereby bee freed from their ſinnes not fully pardoned them ere they went hence; they ſhall neuer bee able to proue. And yet theſe are the thinges that they muſt proue, or elſe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of praying for the dead is left vnproued. For with one voice, euen they that otherwiſe ſeeme moſt to fauour them in this point, holde, <hi>that there is no purgation or clenſing from ſinne, but onely in the bloud of Chriſt; that here pardon of ſinnes is to bee obtained or neuer;</hi> and <hi>that after this life ended, there is no bettering or altering the ſtate of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, before the laſt iudgement:</hi> all which are poſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery one is ſufficient, to quench the fire of the Popiſh purgatorie, and to ouerthrowe their ende of praying for the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18269:235"/> dead. For proofe whereof let vs but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of theſe ſpeeches and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theirs, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt an infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of like force vttered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>The authour of thoſe tracts of <hi>Iob</hi> (commonly fathered of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> from whence often they would ſeeme in this caſe to haue great furniture) deſcrybing the faſhion of the church in his time, ſaieth in the third tract or booke: <hi>we celebrate not the day of our natiuity, ſeeing it is the entrance into ſorrowe &amp; temptation, but the day of our death, as the very laying aſide of all our ſorrowes, and the baniſhing of all te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, becauſe they die not, but liue for euer which ſeeme to die: and therefore,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>we keepe the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Saints, and of our parents, and frendes which die in the faith, as reioycing for their reſt, ſo begging for our ſelues conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For vpon the 4. of the <hi>Hebrewe;</hi> hom. 4. he ſaieth, <hi>that if we come to the throne of grace now, we ſhall haue grace, &amp; mercy, now is the time of gifts, after of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> and in his ſermon <hi>de Euchariſtiâ in Eucaen. there is</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>after this life ended no negotiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this is the time of ſuffering or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that of crowns; this of labour; that of eaſe, this of ſorow, that of reward:</hi> &amp; therefore in the 7. <hi>Hom:</hi> vpon the 2. of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> ſhewing a reaſon of the ſolemnities vſed at burials, he ſaieth, <hi>that the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof is, that we may glorify God &amp; giue him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, that hath crowned &amp; taken to himſelfe our brother departed, &amp; freed him from his labours &amp; ſeruitude; are not our Pſalmes &amp; hymnes for this &amp; our ſinging, omnia iſta gaude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſunt,</hi> al theſe (ſaith he) are the doings of men that reioyce. <hi>&amp; de beato Philogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he writeth, <hi>Ego fide iubeo &amp;c.</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, I doe pawne my credit, if any depart from his ſinnes with his whole heart, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnfeinedly promiſe vnto God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will returne no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For firſt they aſſure vs, <hi>that the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt doth clenſe vs from all ſinne.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>and that hee ſo bare our ſinnes in his owne body vpon the tree, that by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 2.

And therefore if theſe fathers, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at any time, or any other, ether by their example or writing, haue in any point, neuer ſo litle in any kind of ſort croſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; the holy canonicall ſcriptures, in any of theſe points, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in praying for the dead, or in laying any grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, we may boldly leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; chuſe rather to cleaue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, let vs now proceed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particuler ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amining of <hi>Iohn de Albines</hi> quotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for their kind of praier for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead.

                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:18269:236"/> as <hi>Hierom</hi> hath truely noted vpon <hi>Titus,</hi> and therefore both there he condemneth that booke as an hereticall booke, and alſo in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of eccleſiaſticall wryters, as a booke writen againſt the Church. <hi>Albine</hi> therfore hath aptlier, then he was aware of, ſought out an heretique, in his hereticall wrytings, to bee the firſt man to ſpeake for the patroniſing of this popiſh hereſie of his. But perhaps he wil ſay, that he learned not of heretiques to ſpeake for prayer for the dead. Whereunto I reply, that if euer he wrote any thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſerue your turne, he learned it of no better ſchoolemaſters then of ſuch, or of philoſophers their ordinarie teachers. For as hee himſelfe writeth, <hi>de praeſcript. aduerſus haereticos, as the original of al trueth was doctrine receaued by the Apoſtles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt: ſo the ſpring of al errour hath beene fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuel, by philoſophers.</hi> And touching this particuler, in his booke <hi>de animâ,</hi> he writeth, that the philoſophers that helde the immortality of the ſoule (as <hi>Pythagoras, Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>) aſſigned for ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, heauen, hell and a thirde purifying place: and in that booke he ſheweth, that <hi>Montanus</hi> his maſter helde, that the Patriarches before Chriſts comming were in hell, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome was in hell, or in the lower parts, that onely perfect men and martyrs went to heauen ſtreight, and that all ſmall offences muſt be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed after this life to the vttermoſt farthing (his paraclet ſo expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that of <hi>Mat. ca. de inf. &amp; vlt:</hi> and in that booke alſo he telleth of a woman lying to bee buried, that at the praiers of the Prieſt ouer her, lifted vp her hands &amp;c. whereby it ſeemeth, that the heretique <hi>Montanus,</hi> &amp; his paraclet, might be very fit ſchoolmaſters to teach him a great part of your doctrine in this point. Further, that you may ſee not only by his own teſtimony, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might haue ſuch ſchool maſters as I haue ſaied, to teach him herein, ſomwhat to fauor you &amp; to ſpeake of your ſide: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his firſt book &amp; 24. chapter teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of the heretique <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> that he was a great admirer of philoſophy, inſomuch, that to the images he made of Chriſt and of ſome of his Apoſtles, he ioyned the images of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of whom hee learned to imagine, that there was a purifying place after this life, and ſo to proue purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of that place of <hi>Matthew,</hi> as you hearde before <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> Paraclet did. And the heretiques <hi>Heracleones,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> wryteth of them, vſed ouer their deade, oyle, balme, water, and inuocation in the Hebrewe tongue. Hereunto ioyne
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18269:236"/> you <hi>Virgils</hi> 6 book of his <hi>Aeneidos</hi> &amp; lying viſions, &amp; you haue the right ſcholemaſters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue taught you, &amp; al that fauour you in this point. But concerning the places in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which you quote, we need not thus anſwere you, for they are not ſo pregnant for you, as you imagined. For the words you ground on, in the firſt place are theſe (ſpoken by him to the wife to teach her how in this point to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue her ſelfe towards her dead huſband) <hi>&amp; pro animâ eius oret &amp; refrigerium interim adpoſtulet ei, &amp; in primâ reſurrectione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortium, &amp; offerat annuis diebus dormitionis eius,</hi> that is, let her pray for his ſoule, and in the meane time deſire refreſhing for him, and felowſhippe in the firſt reſurrection, and let her offer alwaies when the yeare day commeth for his ſleeping: which are the words as <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> confeſſeth, that he hath ſo ſet downe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he found it far otherwiſe, in all examples before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, not onely this obſcurity of <hi>Tertullians</hi> wordes, and the vncertainety what they were, diſableth this place from being of any force for you to ground vpon, but alſo vnles you muſt haue it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that euery womans huſband, to whom he gaue this counſel, was in purgatorie, wherof there is no ground at all in his wordes in that booke, but rather the contrary, whereby it ſhould ſeeme that he ſpake of ſuch, as were gone before in peace to the Lord: his words, if they were theſe, proue not your praying to relieue ſoules there. And the offering that he laſtly ſpeaketh of was either the offering of thankes to God for his quiet reſt, and ſleeping, or an offering or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of almes to the poore, in token of ioy for the ſame, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them to be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keful therfore alſo, as you heard me before note, the faſhion was when the tracts of <hi>Iob,</hi> fathered vpon <hi>Origen</hi> were writen, out of the third tract of the ſame: and not as you woulde haue it taken, an offering of your propitiatory ſacrifice in your maſſe for his ſinnes. For hee ſaieth for his falling a ſleepe, and not for his ſinnes, and hee willeth the woman to offer, and not that ſhe ſhould get the Prieſt to doe it. And in anſwering of this place, your other is alſo anſwered, for there onely he ſaieth <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones pro defunctis, pro natalitiis annuâ die facimus,</hi> that is, wee offer oblations for the dead, for their birth daies, euery yeares day. For in that he expreſly ſaieth <hi>pro natalitiis,</hi> for their birth daies, it is euident that he cannot, nor may not be vnderſtood, of any other oblation, but of thankefulneſſe and reioicing. But this offering for their birth daies, <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> vpon this place in his
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18269:237"/> notes ſaieth, <hi>was heatheniſh, and afterwards was condemned and aboliſhed by the Nicene councell and others.</hi> And yet for any thing that theſe words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> enforce in this place, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of no other oblations for the dead, but for their birth daies, ſo that long ago the date and credit of this teſtimony and faſhion was abrogated And laſtly, it is not to be forgotten, that he himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few lines after theſe words, ſpeaking of this faſhion &amp; of ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that there alſo he had ſpoken of, plainely confeſſeth, <hi>that theſe thinges had no grounde in the ſcriptures, but onely by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> That which other of your fellowes alleadge to this purpoſe out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his exhortation to charity, may receiue the ſame anſwere with theſe, for it is euident, that booke alſo was writen in his <hi>Montaniſme,</hi> for there hee is againſt ſecond marriage as in the firſt, and ſo againſt <hi>Paul, Romans.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and with <hi>Montanus:</hi> and the words are no more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ground praier to relieue ſoules in purgatory, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were.</p>
                  <p>Now next is <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was a biſhop in that City, wherein ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Tertullian</hi> had liued, in him for your praier for the dead, you would haue vs read his Epiſtle <hi>ad plebem Furnenſem,</hi> in his firſt booke. I am ſure you meane the ninth Epiſtle of that booke, writen, as it appeareth there, <hi>ad plebem Furnilanorum,</hi> though either you could not or would not (to put your reader to a little more paines to ſeeke it out) tell vs ſo much. But hauing found it and read it, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you were perſwaded of it, we finde little or nothing there, that can doe you any good, for onely there, of a decree made in ſome <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricane</hi> Synode before his time, he groundeth his perſwaſion to that people, foraſmuch as one <hi>Victor</hi> had contrary to that decree, made one <hi>Heminius Fauſtinus</hi> miniſter, executour of his wil and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, therefore to ſtay others from daring any more ſo to violate that decree, to the calling away the miniſters from attendance of their miniſtry; that they ſhould execute that decree againſt that their brother <hi>Victor</hi> departed: which was, that for this cauſe, there ſhould be no offering for him, nor ſacrifice for his falling a ſleepe. For ſaieth he, <hi>he is not worthy to be named in the praier of the Prieſt, that wil ſo cal away the miniſters or Prieſts from the altar: &amp; therefore ſeeing this is Victors fault, let there be no oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with you for his ſleeping, nor in his name any deprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the Church.</hi> Doe you thinke in good earneſt (Maſter <hi>Albine</hi>) that if <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:18269:237"/> had thought, that his brother <hi>Victors</hi> ſoule, had bene in ſuch paines in purgatory, as you teach are there, and that theſe were the ordinarie meanes to eaſe ſoules there, that for ſo ſmall a matter as this, the breaking of this poſitiue law (which with you is vſually broken) if in your ſence, theſe things were to be vnderſtoode of oblation, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and praier, for the eaſe of the party ſo departed, from vnder the puniſhment vpon him for his ſinnes: that <hi>Cyprian</hi> either might lawfully, could without too too much cruelty, or would ſo without all mercy and charity, perſwade to depriue a brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted of theſe things? You cannot be ſo without reaſon, as once to thinke ſo. The execution of this Canon againſt <hi>Victor,</hi> was but onely a note of ſome diſgrace &amp; ignominy laied vpon him, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make others after to regarde that Canon, and not any deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſoule any thing, ſo neceſſary for it, as you would make men beleeue, your prayers for the dead be. For that had beene then, furiouſly for a trifle to rage againſt the dead. But alas (maſter <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi>) both you and your fellowes are wonderfully deceaued, in thinking that <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant here by oblation, ſacrifice and prayer as you doe. For queſtionles, by oblation and ſacrifice, he meant but the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankeſgiuing, and therefore he ſaied, not <hi>pro peccatis eius,</hi> for his ſins, but <hi>pro dormitione eius,</hi> for his ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and by praier, not praier for to eaſe him of his ſinnes, but the publique and ordinary praier, wherein then they vſed to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration or remembrance of the godly brother departed, the better to prouoke others thereby to imitate him: which you might perceaue by his ſaying, <hi>he deſerueth not to be na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed in the praier of the Prieſt.</hi> All which you might the better haue learned thus to vnderſtande, if you had remembred that the ſame <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> in his fourth booke of epiſtles, <hi>epiſt.</hi> 5. hauing ſpoken of certaine famous Martyrs, <hi>Celerin, Laurence,</hi> and <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> addeth: <hi>for theſe alwaies, you remember, wee offer ſacrifices as oft as wee ſolemnize the paſsions and dayes of the Martyrs, anniuerſariâ commemoratione, with a yearely commemoration.</hi> For I am ſure you holde that theſe were not in purgatory, and that therefore theſe ſtoode in no neede to haue an oblation and ſacrifice of the maſſe offered for them, or praiers in your ſence to be made for them. Yea how can theſe otherwiſe be vnderſtoode, then of the oblation and ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing, in the memorial or remembring the godly life and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18269:238"/> conſtant Chriſtian death of ſuch? And ſo we neither diſlike the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, of ſuch thankful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorations of the godly departed now, nor deny that of ancient time, for the comfort and inſtruction of them that were aliue, that it hath beene vſed. And of this offering of the oblation of praiſe and thankeſgiuing for the faithfull departed, very well may and muſt that be vnderſtoode, which vſually you alleadge ſo much out of the Lyturgies, which you father vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome.</hi> For you know in offering it, they teach you to offer it to God, for thoſe that are at reſt in faith: their elders, their fathers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Martyrs, and for <hi>Mary</hi> the bleſſed Virgin her ſelfe. For I hope, you thinke not all theſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in neede to be offered &amp; praied for, to be eaſed in purgatory. And yet your praying for the dead, &amp; your purgatory are right <hi>Hypocrates</hi> twins, they muſt laugh and weepe togither, they muſt ſtand and fal, beginne and ende both at once.

Canon (which is the laſt thereof) not onely of a commemoration of the dead, but of ſome offering, when that was, or when the feaſts of martyrs in their memories were kept, of mony or ſome other thing for the reliefe of the needy, where order is taken for the receauing of it, and beſtowing of it: which either were the free will offerings of the liuing, to teſtifie their thankfulneſſe to God, for the good depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the dead, or bequeſts and legacies of the dead, to the reliefe of the poore, &amp; other holy vſes, againſt the ſtaying &amp; detaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Vaſe</hi> ſharplie decreed. And it appeareth in <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> martyrs ſecond apologie, that euen ſo long ago, after the communion, there was an oblation of almes giuen for ſuch vſes, but he in neither of his apologies (though therein hee ſhewe what the forme and maner of the Chriſtians ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of GOD then was, of purpoſe) once remembreth ſo much as any commemoration then made of the dead in their aſſemblies.

                     <hi>Tobias</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elder (though there be much ſaied of him to his commendation in burial of the dead in his hiſtory) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet there is not any mention of any ſuch thing done by him. And it is worth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from the time of <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be proued by any ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after, vntil now of very late daies, that any ſuch thing was by any godly man attempted againe. Further yet, how can this ſerue to breed any credit to popiſh praying or ſacrificing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory? ſeeing the papiſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues confeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was no purgatory before the comming of Chriſt: &amp; that they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> die in deadly ſinne (as it appeareth by the ſtory theſe did) go not at all thither, but ſtreight to hell. Laſtly, for any thing I can ſee in the authours words, thorowly conſidered, it may be ſaied, for his credit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus</hi> did thus, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did very well &amp; honeſtly to thinke &amp; hope of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection, &amp; very godly to be perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then it ſhould be very well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe that died godly: but that vpon theſe cogitations he did thus for theſe, he doeth not at all iuſtifie him, but rather ſhew that therein he followed his owne reaſon and diſcourſe. And this being thus, all the ſtrength of this place is loſt. For an hiſtoriographer may and doeth ſet downe often, aſwell the faults, as commendable things of famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they write of. Wherefore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point, for all this, it remaineth firme and ſound that I ſaied before, they can neither by ſcripture, nor any ſound ancient writer, approue their ſacrificing, offering, or praying for the reliefe of ſoules in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to go on, now we are come to examine <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which are two onely here cyted for prayer for the dead by <hi>Albine,</hi> namely his 12 Homily vpon <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and his 8. booke vpon the <hi>Romans cap.</hi> 11. in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> places, let them be read neuer ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there ſhal not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo much as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of prayers for the dead
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:18269:240"/> indeede in both of them there is ſome mention of a purging fire, but as I haue ſhewed before in the firſt entrance into this point, when I repeated the words of the authour in theſe places, none at all of the popiſh purgatorie. For in the firſt, he ſpeaketh <hi>of that fire that muſt conſume our hay, woode, and ſtubble, which,</hi> hee telleth vs, <hi>is God, who is a conſuming fire of ſuch things,</hi> and in the other he ſpeaketh expreſly of the fire and torments of hell, <hi>wherein,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>he that would not be purged by the Euangelicall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique doctrine, reſerueth himſelfe to be purified.</hi> Thus thou maieſt ſee (good reader) that which I admoniſhed thee of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how they proue praying for the deade, by mention of a purging fire: though it be mentioned neuer ſo diuerſly, and farre from their ſence, as in theſe two places it is moſt euident it is, whereby thou maieſt ſee, how, with out all conſcience, they ſeeke to abuſe thee, with fond reaſons and ambiguity of words. Belike, though the Scripture ſaie, <hi>in hell there is no redemption,</hi> yet Maſter <hi>Albine</hi> beleeues by his alleadging the later of theſe places, <hi>Damaſcenes</hi> tale of <hi>Gregories</hi> getting <hi>Traians</hi> ſoule out of hell by praier, and that Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> and others alſo haue done and now can doe the like, or at leaſt, that he and his fellowes haue beene fowely deceiued, that before now made it a diſtinct place from hell. In earneſt let them take heede, whom they haue perſwaded hitherto, &amp; doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that they go but thither, and that they (ſo they will take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they may be well paide for it) will helpe them to eaſe there, and out in the ende, that they finde not indeede the popiſh purgatorie they dreamt of, in the ende to proue nothing elſe but the fire and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell it ſelfe, that <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaketh of. But to haſte to an ende of this point, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> are yet behind, it may be theſe ſpeake ſomething more directly to the purpoſe: it cannot bee denied they doe, but the more a great deale was their weakeneſſe and fault, and neuertheleſſe yours euen where it was. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is alleadged onely in his third homily vpon the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where ſpeaking, as it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by his words, of ſuch as die in their ſinnes and infidelity, ſo that they go to hell, where (ſaieth he) <hi>peccata exuere non licet,</hi> that is, they cannot put of their ſinnes, he exhorteth their frends aliue to mourne bitterly for ſuch, becauſe, they are with the damned all the daies of their life, that ſo the better they may take heede of the like ſinne, ſo yet to ſhewe their loue: and in the ende addeth, <hi>defleamus iſtos,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18269:240"/> iuuemꝰ eos pro viribus &amp;c.</hi> let vs mourne for theſe, let vs to our pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er helpe theſe, let vs procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome helpe, little indeed, yet let vs helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How &amp; what way? praying for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs exhort alſo others to pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ceaſing let vs giue almes for them. <hi>Habet res iſta no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nihil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolationis,</hi> this thing hath ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. What is this to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great &amp; vnſpeakeable good, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, you fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and almes giuing for the dead? Yea I wonder how you are not aſhamed to quote vs this place for your praying for the dead, ſeeing you your ſelues (as iuſtly you may) condemne as not onely fruitles, but as quite vnlawful, all praying and giuing of almes, for ſuch as hee ſpeaketh of. But you will ſaie, that going on in the ſame place ere hee haue done, he goeth further, and ſaieth, <hi>that in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuine myſteries, it was not in vain decreed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that ther ſhould a memory be made of the departed hence, they know that great good would grow vtno them hereby: and how can it be, but that all the people and Prieſts praying and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp their hands to heauen, and the reuerend ſacrament laied there, but that we ſhould pacifie God praying for theſe; but that which we ſay now, we ſpeake of them that departed hence in the faith.</hi> I graunt theſe words there follow, but yet the moſt that theſe words proue, is, that he thought the commemoration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead was inſtituted by the Apoſtles: and that the doing thereof at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lords Supper would be very accceptable vnto God, and doe them ſome good. But in all this, if you vnderſtand him aright, here is nothing ſaied for your praying for the eaſe of ſoules in purgatory. For as before he ſpake of thoſe, that were in hel, in the ſtate of damnation, ſo he ſpeaketh this of thoſe that were in the ſtate of ſaluation already, with Chriſt their king in a bleſſed eſtate, and that departed hence in ſure faith thereof, as his owne words entring into this matter and concluding the ſame make it manifeſt. For all that he ſpeaketh of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> die, or are dead, he deuideth onely into theſe two ſortes, &amp; hauing firſt taught what is to be done for the wicked, vnfaithfull &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned ones: then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth &amp; ſheweth thus, what is to be done for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. And therfore eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by your own receiued doctrine, ſpeaking but of theſe, you can vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him but of a tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of ſuch, in their praiers. But ſuppoſe he made an other diſtribution of the dead, into bad, good, and meane, as you doe, and that he ſpake theſe words of the meane in your ſence, what reaſon is there why you ſhould binde vs to allow of his opinion in this, and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18269:241"/> that you your ſelues will not allow, neither of that which he taught before to be done for the damned, nor of that which immediatly after theſe words he ſetteth downe of thoſe that die being yet but <hi>catechu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meni,</hi> that is, but learners of the catechiſm, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith they barred of this comfort and left altogither deſtitute of all helpe but of one, that is, that almes might be giuen in their name, wherby ſome refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing might come vnto them: whereas you ſaie that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did well in praying for <hi>Gratian,</hi> who yet died vnbaptized. Yet this you will ſay is ſomewhat, that he fathereth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead that he ſpeaketh of, vpon a decree of the Apoſtles. I graunt it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,&amp; more then you haue heard his ancient, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> hath done, or any other before him, &amp; yet be it ſomwhat or more, you are neither ſomwhat, nor any more nearer your purpoſe then you were in the beginning. But to conclude with him, though he &amp; 20 more ſuch as he, ſhould neuer ſo often tel vs that it was decreed by the Apoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuine myſteries, there ſhould ſuch memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be made of the dead, they muſt pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs if we beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not. For if they would be beleeued indeede in ſo ſaying, wee haue learned to ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaied vnto ſuch, as in his time vnder ſuch colours troubled the Church w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their own fancies: <hi>legite hoc nobis de lege &amp;c.</hi> Read vs it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, the prophets, pſalms, goſpel, or writings of the Apoſtles, that we may beleeue it. <hi>De vnit: eccleſ. ca.</hi> 6. For euen of <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> himſelfe we are taught ſo to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence theſe canonical ſcriptures for their ſufficiency, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that cannot proue that which he ſaieth therby, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in ſome other way not graunted him, he is a theefe, hom. 58. in <hi>Iohan.</hi> And therfore he is not to thinke much, if we refuſe to credit him in this, which he can neuer proue to be as he ſaieth, by any ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d proofe either out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture or elſe where. Thus therfore to diſmiſſe him let vs ſee laſt of al what is brought vs out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Out of him three places are cited, the firſt is out of his 2 booke <hi>de Geneſi,</hi> againſt the <hi>Manichees, cap.</hi> 20. where there is not a word ſpoken of praying for the dead: onely there (ſaieth he, ſpeaking of ſuch as haue not whiles they were here wel tilled their field, but let it be ouergrowen or oppreſſed with thornes) that ſuch after this life ſhal either haue the purging fire, or eternal paine: by which purging fire what he vnderſtandeth, it is hard to geſſe, hee had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie variable opinions thereof, as I haue ſhewed before, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hence no good argument can be drawen, to proue, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18269:241"/> the popiſh purgatory. I am ſure they are not ſo in loue with this place, that to proue their purgatory hence, they will now teach that ſuch as he ſpeaketh of ſhall go thither. For how coulde he haue deſcribed the worſt ſort of men more liuely, then he doeth thoſe that he ſpeaketh of. For is not he an extreame bad one, that hath ſo neglected here the field of his minde, that he carieth it hence men ouergrowen and oppreſſed with thornes? Sure ſuch as theſe, go ſtraight to hell, or elſe none.

This is the argument of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the firſt and laſt, middlemoſt &amp; all, that in trueth you haue for this, of any weight.

For to make you in loue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, and euen for the ſake thereof alone, to hold on your plea in this cauſe, purgatory hath ſo pickt other mens purſes, &amp; filled yours; &amp; ſo diſpoſſeſſed others, &amp; poſſeſſed you: and praying for ſoules there, hath ſo brought in paiments to you, &amp; pilled and poled the heires &amp; frends of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, that if you wil ſpeake for any thing, ſurely you will ſpeake &amp; neuer giue ouer ſpeaking, for this. <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes Angelus,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome credit of your ſide, ſaieth, <hi>that the ſoules that are in purgatory are of the Popes iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; that he, if he would, could at once eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> empty purgatory:</hi> &amp; therfore (as it ſhould ſeeme) by his owne right, your Pope <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> the 6. in his time, by his buls co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo many ſoules, as he thought good. But I pray you, this being thus, why neither did he, nor any before him, being ſo holy &amp; merciful fathers to their ſubiects &amp; clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they are, take ſuch compaſſion of the poore ſoules there, as of charity and compaſſion to ridde them all thence at once? The reaſon was, that this your onely argument of gaine ſtill to grow thereby, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time in force. For doubtles it is not to be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a noble raſe of holy &amp; moſt holy fathers, would haue ſtayed all this while, from doing ſuch a wonderfull worke of mercie and Chriſtian compaſſion, vnles there had beene ſome ſuch great reaſon of their doings. Well then, becauſe <hi>venter non habet aures,</hi> the belly hath no eares, and a minde deſirous and greedy of gaine, will neuer be ſatiſfyed, I wil not take vpon me any further, to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle againſt this argument, onely I warne you, that euen in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, you be not any longer found, within the number of thoſe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, that <hi>Paul</hi> tolde the <hi>Philippians</hi> often of, and then when hee wrote vnto them told them of them weeping, <hi>which were enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt (for they ſought their owne and not that which was Ieſus Chriſts: cap.</hi> 1.)

And in the meane time, vntill by this warning you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and will learne to take heede, for this argument ſake, to giue ouer to plead any more for your praying for the deade, to eaſe ſoules in purgatory, amongſt an 100. other queſtions, that hang vndecided thereabout amongſt you, I pray you learne to anſwere this, how it chanceth, that ſince the light of the Goſpel came amongſt vs in theſe later daies, to the detection and conſumption of your glorious Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kingdome, we hauing heard before tydings of ſo many, that apparitions of ſoules that are troubled there, and would be eaſed are growen now to gayſon and rare. And if you would haue your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof run currant, as a plaine and reſolute point, I pray you alſo let vs vnderſtand, how it came to paſſe, not long ſince, that <hi>S.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:18269:244"/> their owne words, or other good euidence, that they were liuing &amp; dying, ſo on your ſide, as you here pretend, I doubt not, but one of vs or other, will eaſily make it euident vnto the world, that you are far greater in words and ſhew, then you are in deedes and trueth. You would haue your reader beleeue, that onely to auoide tediouſnes to him, you haue forborne by their teſtimonies liuing and dying, here to confirme all the reſt of your doctrine, and all that you doe vſe at this day: but alas your owne conſcience telleth you, that indeed not onely the tediouſnes of it to your ſelfe, but the impoſſibility of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither, drew you to be glad to vſe this prety ſhift &amp; piece of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, to ſalue your credit &amp; your cauſes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering therfore what already hath beene anſwered to the fathers quoted by you in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter (in whoſe euidence for thoſe matters belike you durſt be boldeſt) &amp; what otherwiſe vpon ſundry other occaſions, in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your booke, I haue ſet downe out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> directly to proue the contrary to this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſay you could proue out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; your queſtion, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vpon the ſuppoſall of your brag here to be but a trueth, you haue inferred &amp; put forth; whither theſe doctours, confeſſours &amp; martyrs that you talke of be in heauen, or hel, is childiſh, friuolous &amp; needles. For you know well enough, that there is neuer a doctour, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, or Martyr, of any credit and worthie ſo to be accounted, for the Catholique Religion they taught and dyed in, but (though in ſome of them, we doe not deny there might be found ſome inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome things now held by you) that yet we holde, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as not onely they held with vs the foundation, and other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points of Chriſtian Religion, wherein you are contrary both vnto them &amp; vs, but that alſo the Lord in his mercy towards them, kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the reſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the groſſenes &amp; impiety that you are therein fallen into ſince; that they were and are ours and not yours. And therefore, we comfortably aſſure our ſelues, that (they holding the foundation and other principall points as they did, though they as men, builded thereupon ſome wood, hay, &amp; ſtubble) yet the Lord ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meanes by the fire of his ſpirit, and affliction, ſo to deſcrie the ſame vnto them, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume al that vnſutable building in them, ere they went hence, that we neede not thorow any ſuch ſcrupuloſitie of conſcience as you imagine, feare to giue our iudgement or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. For wee feare not their being in hell, for being on your ſide, but in that they were of ours, as they were and as I haue ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wee chriſtianly perſwade our ſelues that their ſoules are in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18269:245"/> heauen. And you, fearing belike for all your cauilling, that touching theſe ancient doctours, confeſſours, and martyrs that this would be our anſwere, becauſe you knew it might iuſtly be ſo, you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent quickely to giue ouer the purſuit of this queſtion, and to aſke vs this, <hi>what wee thinke in our conſcience, of thoſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed your faith &amp; Religion, whither they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or no?</hi> And to feare vs, from ſaying they be; vpon the necke of this, you aſke vs, <hi>if it were ſo, why then was the bloud of Chriſt ſhed;</hi> affirming confidently, <hi>that if this were ſo, that then it had beene better that Chriſt had neuer ſuffered.</hi> This indeede I doe know to be one of your common bugges, whereby you ſeeke to make the ſimple affraide, either to forſake you, or to ioyne with vs: ſaying when you ſee men about thus to doe, <hi>what, will you condemne all your forefathers?</hi> And to this end with manie words you a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plifie the goodnes of the forefathers, <hi>&amp; what an vnchriſtian cruelty it is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne all our ancient forefathers?</hi> Before I come to the anſwering of which obiection, I cannot but tell you, that in ſetting downe ſo bluntly &amp; boldly, as you haue, that if they that confeſſed and maintained your Religion be condemned, that then it had beene better that Chriſt neuer had died, you haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered groſſe &amp; intollerable blaſphemy. For though none ſuch ſhould be ſaued by the death of Chriſt, thouſand thouſands both haue bene and ſhalbe ſaued therby: &amp; better it were that al ſuch, as you meane, ſhould for euer be condemned, then that this ſpeech of yours had any trueth in it. But to anſwer this your obiection, taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſnes of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning forefathers, becauſe by the na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you keep men, as you doe, in your Romiſh and Babilonical captiuity: firſt the reader is to vnderſtand, that an argument take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forefathers ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, without diſtinction, but as you doe this of yours, in matters of Religion, is not good. For <hi>Ez.</hi> 20. we read that the Lord ſaied thus vnto his people, <hi>walke not in the preceps of your fathers, neither obſerue their maners, nor defile your ſelues with their idols.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. <hi>Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be as their forefathers were, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; rebellious generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> And the like warning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Ier.</hi> 11. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> telleth the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to whom he wrote, <hi>that by the bloud of Chriſt, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation of their fathers,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. If this argument had beene good, when Chriſt came, &amp; ſent his Apoſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to preach the goſpell to al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: our forefathers in all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:18269:245"/> then did ill, in receiuing the doctrine of the goſpell. For their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for ſome 1000. yeares before, had held, profeſſed, &amp; mainteined heatheniſh paganiſme. And it ſeemeth that many of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then, vſed this very argument of yours, to keepe men in paganiſme ſtill. For ſuch an obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I read, both made by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; anſwered by <hi>Peter</hi> as it is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis lib.</hi> 5. <hi>recognitionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>) by <hi>Ignatius, ad Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes:</hi> &amp; by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in <hi>quaeſt. veteris, &amp; noui teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti quaeſt.</hi> 114. By this reaſon, ſaied <hi>Peter</hi> (as <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> reports it) <hi>If a mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a thiefe, or a bawde, the child muſt be no other.</hi> To ſuch as ſaied they would beleeue no other goſpell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had, <hi>Ignatius</hi> anſwereth; <hi>my antiquity is Ieſus Chriſt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to obey, is manifeſt damnation. That which was before,</hi> ſaieth <hi>Auguſtine, the Paganes ſay, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be bad.</hi> To whom he anſwereth ſaying; <hi>as though antiquity may preiudice trueth. For thus might murderers, wantons, adulterers, &amp; other lewd liuers, defend their wickedneſſes; becauſe they are old, &amp; haue beene fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> ſaieth he. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both ſcripture, reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues teach vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not alwaies ſafe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the Religion, wherein our forefathers liued &amp; died; and ſo eaſily we may perceiue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this your argument, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſoeuer it be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, is of no force. For it hath beene the old argument of <hi>Pagans,</hi> &amp; doubtles is at this day, the chiefe argument y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> keepeth <hi>Turks,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jewes</hi> from yeelding to the Goſpell, leaſt then they ſhould condemne all their forefathers.</p>
                  <p>But as your argument is naught, ſo your antecedent is falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For albeit that our Religion differ from yours, as it doeth; yet farre is it from vs, that therefore we condemne all our forefathers. For, firſt we know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, wel near 1000. yeares, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that profeſſed Chriſt, for the moſt part, liued &amp; died, holding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; many other principall points of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs; &amp; therfore of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we doubt not. Secondly, euer ſince, howſoeuer a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mber fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trueth &amp; ſeemed wholy to be yours, yet we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; we know it to be true; eſpecially ſince <hi>Petrus Vald</hi> his time, who was 400. yeares ago; there haue beene great &amp; knowen multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, openly ioyning with vs, in the chiefeſt points of our religion, &amp; diſſenting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, as I haue ſhewed before. And when there ſeemed to be feweſt, yet we beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could &amp; did preſerue vnto himſelf, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in ſuch a miſerable time, asking <hi>Ahabs</hi> time was. 7000. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there, had not bowed their knees to <hi>Baal:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God, I ſay, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> popery ſeemed to haue preuailed moſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:18269:246"/> to the comfortable viſions, that <hi>Iohn</hi> had to that end, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14, yet had preſerued vnto him, in al the kingdomes, and prouinces of the world, infinite numbers, that yet neither in forehead nor hand, would beare the marke of the beaſt: &amp; of all theſe we hope well alſo. Thirdly, euen concerning ſuch of our forefathers, as ſeemed to the world, to be of your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we thinke a number alſo are ſaued. For euen amongſt them, there are .3. ſortes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. The firſt ſort are they, that liued and died in all your groſſe and erronious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The ſecond are they, that though a long time they ſeemed to liue in them, yet ere they died, God cauſed to ſee the vanity thereof, at leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning your doctrine of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; ſo through the ſight of their ſins, in his mercy, he brought them to die, proteſting that they truſted not to be ſaued in part, nor in whole by their owne works, or by any other meanes, but onely by his free mercy, through Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The third ſort is of them, which though they were yours for ſome outward ceremonies, that they were contented to vſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, &amp; in that they held ſome other fond opinions with you; yet neuer ioined with you indeed, in ſeeking for ſaluation, little or much by any thing that you taught them to put their truſt in, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way; but only looked for &amp; beleeued, to attaine vnto it, for that which Chriſt had done once for all for them, in his owne body. The firſt ſort are they only of whom there is feare. But of that number, we hope there haue beene but few in compariſon that is ſuppoſed. Of the other two ſorts, we haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hope, becauſe we know our God is moſt ready to receiue a ſinner, whenſoeuer he vnfeinedly repenteth, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> hath taught vs, <hi>that they that hold the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt Ieſus, aright; though through ignorance, or other infirmity, they builde thereupon, hay, and ſtubble, yet in the end, they may be ſaued,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Whereby euery one, may eaſily perceiue, that we hope that moſt of our forefathers, by one of theſe means, or other, haue bene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that for them, the bloud of Chriſt was ſhed vpon the Croſſe, &amp; that to the ſauing of infinite thouſand ſoules, though neuer a one of them that liued and died, fully of your religion in al points, be ſaued. And therfore very bad, and blaſphemous is your ſaying, as I cannot but tel you againe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then it had beene better y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had not ſuffered at al. Hereby alſo you may ſee, that we grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the hope that we haue (as you imagine) concerning the ſaluation of our forefathers, vpon their ignorance; but vpon that faith that they liued and died in, or died in at the leaſt, to be ſaued ſolie, and wholie, fully and freely by
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18269:246"/> the ſuffrings and obedience of Chriſt. For howſoeuer ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may excuſe <hi>de tanto,</hi> yet it cannot <hi>de toto.</hi> That is, howſoeuer ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may leſſen the offence, yet it cannot make an offence, no offence. And though we read, <hi>that he that knoweth his maſters will, and doeth it not, ſhal be beaten with more ſtripes;</hi> yet we read not, that hee that knoweth it not, and ſo doeth it not, ſhall not bee beaten at all. But rather we reade, that the Lord ſaieth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 95. <hi>They are a people that erre in their heartes, for they haue not knowen my waies, wherefore I haue ſworne in my wrath ſaying, ſurely, they ſhall not enter into my reſt.</hi> Indeed, in that that you haue more meanes now, to reclaime you, from your errours and hereſies, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your forefathers had, theſe many years; we thinke in trueth that it will be far eaſier, at the day of iudgement, for them, then for you: in that you haue ioined wilful ſtubbernes, to your other ſins. But, whatſoeuer come of it, this is moſt certaine, <hi>that whoſoeuer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth the beaſt, &amp; his image, and receiueth his marke, in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and hand, and ſo dieth;</hi> (for of ſuch there the holy Ghoſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:) <hi>the ſame man ſhall drinke, of the wine of Gods wrath, and be torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for euer, in fire &amp; brimſtone, before the holy Angels, and the Lambe, Apoc.</hi> 14. And this muſt ſtand, <hi>that he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not in the Sonne, is condemned already; becauſe he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not in the onely begotten Sonne, Iohn.</hi> 3. How many ſoeuer this ſentence hath within the compaſſe of it, thus it ſhall go with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This alſo we may not, nor cannot deny, but that there, by beleeuing in him, is meant beleeuing in him aright: and that we do not vnleſſe we count <hi>his name, the only name wherby we come to ſaluation, Act.</hi> 4. and that ſo, as in him, we thinke &amp; beleeue, <hi>that al things are already prepared, Mat.</hi> 22. &amp; therfore doe not ſuffer our ſelues, by any perſwaſion, to be brought, to ioyne any perſon, or thing, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him in iuſtifying vs before God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. Let men therefore take heed of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or dying, without this true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, whatſoeuer they do, for without this, we are not in Chriſt; and if we be not in him, wee wither, and come to the fire in the end, as fruitles and dead braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. And indeed, if we thus haue not him, wee can neither come by that life that is in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. neither can we poſſibly eſcape damnation, which is prepared for al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God that doe not aright imbrace him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. In this caſe therefore, in the name of God, let vs not looke what our fathers haue done, but what they ſhould haue done. And let vs learne rather to imitate thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:18269:247"/> yea, though they were neuer ſo few; that haue liued and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this faith; then thoſe others, that haue both liued and died, out of it. For we may aſſure our ſelues, that neither ignorance, imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forefathers, nor any thing elſe, wil or can exempt vs, from that condemnation, that is due to ſuch as liue and die, thus in this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental errour, or hereſie.</p>
                  <p>It is too too childiſh that you infer of the condemnation of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> and <hi>Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and al that were in their times, by our religion: in that you ſaie they preached againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one, for his not allowing the expoſition of the Doctors, and refuſing to honor the reliques of Saints: &amp; againſt the other, for that they taught it was an offence, to pray for the dead. For firſt, you ſee, we doe not condemne any man, for euery error; nay, we conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e that liue and die holding aright the foundation; though otherwiſe, they haue had their errors. And ſecondly, though it were graunted, that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Arrians</hi> taught theſe 3, points, &amp; that we are like them in theſe; and that we hold them for things well done, and taught by them; whatſoeuer either <hi>Hierom</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; muſt it needs therupon follow, that either we, or they were deceiued, or elſe that <hi>Hierom</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and their partakers be condemned? Nay we are not ſo haſtie to pronounce ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, of them or any other, for ſuch errors: neither would you be ſo haſtie to gather ſuch concluſions, if you were wiſe. For you know well enough, that we make not theſe matters ſuch, as that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we thinke all muſt be ſaued that holde the one way, or all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that hold the other. But in trueth you doe charge both <hi>Vigilantius</hi> and the <hi>Arrians</hi> with more, then I thinke you wil proue in haſt. For neither doe I read that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was ſuch an enemy to the expoſition of Doctors; nor the <hi>Arrians</hi> charged with deniall of praier for the dead; neither thinke I, euer did you; and therefore it ſhould ſeeme here, you had no quotation. Againe, you iniury vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; in that you would make your reader beleeue, that we refuſe all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Doctors; which we neuer did. This onely we doe, as they themſelues haue taught; examine their iudgements, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions by the Scriptures, which when we haue done, if we finde them therewith to agree, we eſteeme of them, as it becommeth vs, and as well, and more then you. But this is your faſhion, vpon your owne head, without proofe, to pinne vpon them that you finde ſpoken againſt, by ſome ancient fathers, what you liſt, to make
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18269:247"/> them like vs. If <hi>Vigilantius</hi> taught that neither ſuch relickes of Saintes, as you make ſtore of, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, nor none at all, are to be honoured as you now honour them; it was no errour at al in him; and if it had beene that he had held but ſo, I am fully perſuaded, that rather <hi>Hierom</hi> would haue commended him for it, then otherwiſe. But indeed your groſſe honouring of them, was not then ſo much as thought of. <hi>Vigilantius</hi> his fault (as it ſeemeth by <hi>Hieroms</hi> charging of him) was, that hee woulde not allowe, that there ſhould ſuch coſt be beſtowed vpon their tombes, and burials, or that any ſuch eſtimation, or reuerend regard ſhould bee had of their graues, and ſepulchers; as then, of loue towardes them, and to ſtirre vp others to imitate them, beganne to be vſed. Wherein, if he went too far, wee ioine not with him. For wee very well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there ſhould be a decent, and comelie buriall of them, and we eſteeme of their graues, and other certaine monumentes of them, as of thinges that appertaine to the deare children of God. But with you, to tie vertue either to the place of their buriall, or to any ſuch thing that they left behinde, and that in ſuch groſſe maner as you haue done, wee account it both folly, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous impiety. It may bee, when you named <hi>Arrians,</hi> you meant <hi>Aerians,</hi> in whom you oft tell vs, that to pray for the dead, was condemned for an hereſie. But if that were your meaning, wee tell you, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writing of them, ſaieth flatlie (howſoeuer they were ſo accounted of ſome) that praier for the dead, hath no manifeſt ground in the Scriptures, but rather leaned to the faſhion and traditions of men (as both of this and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all the pointes in controuerſie betwixt you and vs, <hi>Soto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Brentium, &amp; Lind. li.</hi> 4. <hi>ſuae panopliae</hi> towards the end thereof, two great champions of your ſide, haue alſo plainely confeſſed) and ſo long you ſhall neuer be able to proue it an hereſie. Againe, here you muſt be admoniſhed, that euery thing that an heretique is reported to haue held, is not by &amp; by hereſie. For many ſound opinions often times, ſuch haue retained, and by that meanes, haue the eaſilier preuailed to ſeduce men, by their errours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you and your fellowes alſo, doe your readers wrong, in making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thinke, that becauſe ſuch an hereticke, &amp; ſuch an hereticke, held this and that, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we hold, therfore we are heretickes. For if you ſhould ſpeake to the purpoſe, you ſhould firſt proue the opinions that wee hold to be hereſies, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew vs that they were held and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18269:248"/> in ſuch and ſuch: or at the leaſt that the things that we hold were in them heretofore condemned for hereſies.</p>
                  <p>But to be briefe, you ſay if our Religion be the trueth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there hath beene neuer a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Doctour in the Church, ſince Chriſt: for all haue taught the contrary &amp;c. Theſe are but your words, and the falſhood of this, I haue made to appeare in ſundry points already. And I would to god, the poor ſimple people could read their works indeede; for then howſoeuer it pleaſe you here to brag to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they ſhould and would perceiue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue in this wounderfullie abuſed them. For they ſhould ſee that for the moſt and greateſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, betwixt you and vs, they are flat on our ſide: &amp; in thoſe things wherein they ſeeme moſt to fauour you, that yet euen therein, there was and is very great difference betwixt you, and them. Wherfore, your vehement exhortation, that men ſhould not follow vs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all Chriſtians that haue beene ſince Chriſt, which taught al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies yours, &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned ours, as hereſy; is ſutable to the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation that is, nothing but falſe &amp; vaine. In like maner where you bring vs here, as men (to auoide your argument of the condemnation of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers) that are ſo driuen to our ſhifts, that we haue nothing to ſay for appeaſing the people, but this, that their errours ſhall not bee imputed vnto them, for that they did holde them of ſimple ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hauing no better inſtruction: in confuting this excuſe, you might haue ſpared your paines. For you may remember, that otherwiſe I haue blunted the edge of that argument. And for my part, I moſt willingly acknowledge that ignorance ſhall not, nor cannot exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any from condemnation, that know not (if they be of yeares, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe capable of knowledge) the Lord Ieſus Chriſt aright to their ſaluation. For I know it is writen, <hi>that Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, rendering vengeance vnto them that know not God, and which obey not the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. and that howſoeuer by ſtrong deluſion vnder Antichriſt, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall be carried to beleeue lies; yet in the iuſt iudgement of God, <hi>becauſe they receaued not the loue of the trueth, they ſhalbe damned, for not beleeuing the trueth,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. But you ſay, ſome haue vſed that excuſe of them, in conference with your ſelfe. I warrant you, not ſimply to excuſe ſuch as liued and died, in an Antichriſtian faith; that is, looking to be ſaued, not onely through the mercie of God, in Chriſt Ieſus; but by other meanes alſo, which can not ſtand together with a ſound faith in Chriſt: but ſuch onely, as either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18269:248"/> the fathers were preſerued from euer falling into this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errour; or hauing fallen into it, had growen to deteſt it, &amp; to imbrace a faith, ſeeking, and finding in Chriſt alone, the full cauſe of their ſaluation ere they died: of which two ſortes, beſides thoſe whom God did cleane preſerue, from the infection of popery, as hee did the 7000. in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, from the idolatry of <hi>Baal;</hi> euen in the greateſt floriſh of poperie, the Lord, no doubt of it, had infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For I my ſelfe in my daies, haue knowen diuers, in whom, the leauen of popery, hath beene ſo rooted, that notwithſtanding neuer ſo good meanes haue beene vſed in their health and proſperity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, yet they haue perſeuered in an opinion, that they ſhould either not be ſaued; or that partly they ſhould be ſaued, for their own merits: who yet in time of ſickenes, or ſome other miſery, hauing therby beene brought as it were, before Gods preſence, and ſo to ſee the infinitenes of his iuſtice: haue ſtraight renounced all confidence in their owne works, with wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful deteſtation of their owne blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous and fooliſh conceit, that euer they truſted in them, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but onely in Chriſt Ieſus; who, now when they knew them ſelues, they would confeſſe, was he that alone muſt ſaue them, by that which he had done himſelfe, or elſe it would neuer be. And if the Lord thus mercifully reclaimed ſome that wilfully, and peeuiſhly a long time, had reſiſted the trueth, ſhining as it doeth now; why ſhould wee not much more conceiue, that hee ſhewed that mercy vpon a number of our forefathers, who dwelt in that errour, of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? That therein, &amp; in a number of things elſe, they erred not; you ſay, but you ſhal neuer be able to proue. Neither can you vpon our holding that they did erre, conclude, that either wee onely are ſaued, or they al condemned. For I haue ſhewed how a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yea infinite numbers of them, might be ſaued, this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. As for your iudgement, that they neuer erred, ſo much as our diſciples; it is not material. For you are no competent iudge in this matter. And the reaſon of your iudgement; that we condemne the faith that the Catholique Church hath held, this 1500. yeares, and maintaine the olde rotten condemned hereſies; is a thing which by begging after this ſort, at our hands, (though therein, you be neuer ſo impudent, and ſhameleſſe a begger; as that way, in this your book your greateſt ſkill hath appeared) you ſhall neuer get. And therefore ſet your hearts at reſt; your words though they be neuer ſo lowde &amp; ſtout, ſhall neuer make vs yeelde you this for an almes. You muſt
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18269:249"/> therefore proue your words true, and ſo make vnto vs euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof; (which you ſhall neuer be able to doe) before we may yeeld vnto you, that you haue any right at all to this.</p>

                  <p>In this Chapter there is nothing but your old great words, &amp; ſtout begging the maine queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that your Church is the true, &amp; ancient Catholicke Church; that al the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s great &amp; ſmall, ſince Chriſt haue bene flat on your ſide: that you are the only men, that follow the ſound ſence of the ſcriptures, deliuered vnto you, by the ancient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and true paſtors of the Church: &amp; that we are but two, or three in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of you; ſprung vp yeſterday, &amp; ſuch as you propheſie wil ſhortly grow banckerout, both of credit, and honeſty. This bladder ful of nothing but winde, is ſufficiently I hope, prickt, and let out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by that which I haue ſaied in ſundry places before. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, I hope the reader is not ſo ſimple, as that (ſeeing in you neuer ſo great ſtore of theſe ſwelling wordes; (as long as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your aduerſaries denie them as ſtoutly of the other ſide: and he ſeeth you bring nothing but bare wordes, without proofe) he wil any whit be mooued therewith. And yet as not able a diſcourſe as this booke of yours is accounted: the greateſt ſtuffing that it hath, is onelie of ſuch vayne wordes as theſe aboue twenty times I am ſure without any proofe at al therein repeated. Indeed, if in al your life, you could proue but halfe ſo much, as confidently here you ſet
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:18269:250"/> downe, then you were a notable fellow indeede, and then truely we would ſtriue no longer with you. But in the meane time, ſeeing we know your ſpeeches are ſuch, as you can neuer proue, and that we are able againſt you, both to proue the falſhoode of yours, and the trueth of our owne; blame vs not, if wee eſteeme not your words.</p>
                  <p>Yet, leſt you ſhould ſaie, that theſe likewiſe are but words in vs, as the former haue beene in you; (though I ſee no reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that our words containing a iuſt and true denial of yours, were ſufficient confutation thereof) I ſay, and will proue it, that you ſhew your ſelfe a man paſt al ſhame, in writing here, as you doe; that all the ancient Catholicke Church, which hath continued viſible, ſince the comming of Chriſt, vnto this day; al the doctours of all the vniuerſities; all the Empires, kingdomes, &amp; priuate ſtates, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al the world, are againſt vs: for they haue al receiued &amp; honoured that doctrine, that we count papiſticall. For firſt, ſuch is the newnes thereof, as I haue plentifully ſhewed in diuers places already, of this booke; that none of all theſe, for ſundry. 100. yeares, were once euer acquainted therwith: yea that diuers of your aſſertions, which are the very principalleſt of your opinions: as namely, your dotcrine of Tranſubſtantiation; of your Popes being in authority, aboue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels; and of denying the cuppe to the lay people; are not yet of 400. yeares age, and continuance. And it is notoriouſly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that in the daies of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9, about the yeare of Chriſt, 1230 by occaſion of iniury and oppreſſion, offered by the Pope, to that Church; that the Greeke &amp; Eaſterne Churches, departed quite from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and neuer ſince (though it hath beene oft at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted) could be brought to hold communion therewith againe; inſomuch that in your conuenticle at <hi>Trent,</hi> you haue condemned them, for ſchiſmatical and heretical Churches. And theſe Churches, as it is noted in an ancient record, in the Church of <hi>Herford,</hi> differ from yours, at the leaſt in 29 articles. And they holde yours excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and an Apoſtata Church vnto this day. And vnleſſe your reading be very ſmall, you cannot be ignorant, that <hi>Math: Pariſ:</hi> writeth, <hi>that the Patriarch of Conſtantinople at the Councell of Lyons, ſhortly after this breach, ſhewed, that of</hi> 30. <hi>biſhoprickes in Greece, the Pope had not three, that then held communion with him: and that all Antioch, and the Empire of Romania, to the gates of Conſtantinople, was gone quite from him.</hi> There is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18269:250"/> alſo extant in print, in ancient record, an Epiſtle writen, about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares after this breach began, in the yeare 1237; by one <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus, Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> vnto the Pope; wherein not only he laboureth, to make him ſee that the occaſion therof was, that he tooke more vpon him ouer thoſe Churches, then he ſhould; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to perſuade him, to ſee his folly, he ſheweth him, <hi>that not onely the Greeke Churches themſelues, but that al ſo the Aethiopians, Syrians, Hiberians, Alani, Gothi, Charari, with innumerable people of Ruſſia, and the mighty kingdome of the Vulgarians, held communion with his Church of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople; and ſo by occaſion of this ſchiſme, had forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Roman Church.</hi> And the Coſmographers write, that the iuriſdiction of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Canſtantinople,</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo farre, that all <hi>Greece, Miſia, Belgaria, Thraſia, Walachia, Moldauia, Ruſſia, Muſcouia,</hi> the iles of the <hi>Aegaean</hi> ſea, and <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, bee vnder the ſame. It is alſo reported by authours of good credit, that at this day, vnder the other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and vnder the other, in the dominions of <hi>Preſbyter Iohn</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> there be infinit numbers of Churches, and Chriſtians, differing from yours, and ioining with ours in manie thinges. So that Churches alſo both in the Eaſt, North, and South, and that of very great amplitude, within the time, that you ſpeake of, haue profeſſed Chriſt, and yet haue neuer beene acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with moſt, or many at the leaſt, of the pointes, for the which, your religion is counted of vs Papiſticall: in all which there haue beene ſome doctours, vniuerſities, Empires; Princes, and priuate men (no doubt) ſince Chriſt, before you wrote, that neither honoured, nor receiued your papiſtical religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea, but that merueilouſly you ouerſhot your ſelfe, you might haue remembred, that within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time limited by you in theſe Weſterne partes, there haue beene euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Popes noſe, and in his greateſt ruffe, many doctours, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, and ſome Emperours, kings, and priuate eſtates, that haue neither receiued, nor ſo honoured your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we cal papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as here, you would beare your reader in hand.

Theſe things conſidered, euen children may ſee not onely the vanity, but groſſe falſhood, of theſe your wordes. For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer either here or elſe where, in this your booke, you would cauſe your reader to beleeue, that your Romiſh Church, is the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church of Chriſt, euery one indeed may ſee, that in trueth it is but a particuler, and a petty Dioceſſe, in compariſon of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church of Chriſt. For the reader muſt vnderſtand, that the Church of Chriſt is called catholicke; firſt, becauſe the religion that ſhee imbraceth, is that which hath beene at al times, &amp; will be to the end, the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God; &amp; ſecondly, becauſe the ſame Church in reſpect of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers therof, eſpecially ſince the calling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is not to be limited or ſhut vp, within the compaſſe, of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler countries, but may vniuerſally be diſperſed amongſt all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in al countreyes, where it pleaſeth the Lord. In neither of which ſences, can the Romiſh Church be truly accounted catholick. For neither is her doctrine that which the true Church of Chriſt embraced, &amp; was in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of for 4000 years &amp; more: neither are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church, vniuerſal; but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Donatiſts ſhut vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church in <hi>Africk,</hi> ſo do the Romaniſts within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of a corner of the world, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of al the reſt, which they cut of, from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. And yet there is nothing more vſual with Maſter <hi>Ioh. de Albine,</hi> in this his book, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to labour to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Synagogue, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe two things, antiquity &amp; vniuerſality.

And if the myſtery of iniquity beganne to worke in the Apoſtle <hi>Paules</hi> time, and yet Antichriſt the father thereof, was not quite to be aboliſhed, before the brightnes of Chriſts ſecond comming, as he plainely teacheth, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. it being withall propheſied, that the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> (Antichriſts right patterne) ſhould ſit vpon many waters (that is, rule ouer many people) and cauſe the kings and nations of the earth, to be drunk with the wine of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as it is <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 17. who ſeeth not that euen Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may be countenanced with great ſhew, both of antiquity, &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality, as certaine and good tokens, as the Romaniſts count theſe two, of the true Church of Chriſt. Which things conſidered, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleaſeth Maſter <hi>Ioh. de Albine</hi> here to ieſt at vs, as men like to the children of God in nothing, but in this folly, that contrary to the faſhion of the wiſe children of the world, we chuſe rather to truſt a few, then many; we are contented therein, to be like them ſtil, and ſo rather to chuſe to enter into the Arke with 8. perſons, <hi>Ge.</hi> 7. ſo to be ſaued: then to refuſe ſo to doe, with all the world beſides, &amp; ſo to be drowned. And I would aduiſe him for al his wiſedome, to be ſuch a foole, as rather with two or three, to flie out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> with <hi>Lot Gen.</hi> 19; then with all the reſt to tarry behinde, and to be deſtroied with fire and brimſtone. For howſoeuer he count this folly, Chriſt who is wiſedome it ſelfe, hath charged his to ſtriue, to enter in at the ſtraight gate, though few go y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, &amp; many the other broad way.

                  <p>But the men whom he nameth, <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi> (though they be men whom we thinke wel of, and whoſe memories ſhal be famous in Gods Church (for al his blinde prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the contrary) when the names of a thouſand ſuch as himſelfe is, ſhal bee either buried in obliuion, or infamous for their reſiſting of Gods trueth) are not the men vpon whom wee build our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And theſe, the ancient Chriſtians and Doctours for ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, and infinite numbers ſince, euen downe vnto the times of theſe, whom he here nameth, as I haue ſhewed in the fourth Chapter of this booke, and elſe where, togither with vs, haue followed.

You ſhew therefore, Maſter <hi>Albine,</hi> but the nature of your Romiſh ſpirit, in your confident aduouching without all proofe, that theſe men you name, gained ſoules to the Deuill, and that they haue ſo fold their honeſty &amp; credit, that few now know that euer they liued in the worlde. For beſides your raſh and vncharitable iudging of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſpeake that which your owne heart tolde you was a lie. For, you could not bee ignorant, but that theſe mens names are knowen to thouſands, that neuer read their ſtories. But you ſay that you agree with vs in not truſting of men, but in truſting to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very word write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but you and we vary about the interpretation: for we interpret it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one ſort, and you after another, we after a new ſort, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, whereby wrongfully ſtil, you meane your owne) doeth follow the olde expoſition of the ancient doctours, and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue forſaken. Herein, you ſay more, then either you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your fellowes wil ſtand to. For when it commeth to the point, the greateſt champions of you confeſſe, that a number of the things. that are in controuerſie betwixt you and vs, are without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of the ſcripture: and therfore leaſt they ſhould be quite reiected, they
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18269:252"/> vnder prop them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the rotten prop (which yet they labour to make to carry ſome ſhew of ſtrength) of traditions, or of the word vnwri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And in the other point, concerning interpretation; that therein we vary, it is true; but that the variety is, as you ſay, it is falſe. For we neuer refuſed the expoſition of the Catholicke Church, nor to vſe the helpe of her ſound and Catholicke Doctours, or traditions agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the word write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as helpeth the better to attaine to the right ſence therof by. Indeed, the interpretation of your new Apoſtata Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her falſe doctours and traditions, becauſe they wil not ſtand with the plaine ſcriptures themſelues, we reiect. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, we are ready alwaies to proue our ſence, thereof, to agree with the ancient Church &amp; her doctours, better then yours can. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> variety amongſt vs, of interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which you charge vs withal; ſure we are, it wil neuer proue ſo great, as hath beene, and is amongſt you, or as is betwixt your interpretation, and that which was of them, 900. yeares ago: and therefore, for any thing you haue yet ſaied, you your ſelues are the rouing ſheepe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ancient ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; you are they which whiles men ſlept, haue ſowed cares amongſt the good corne: and which are the ſheepe ſicke in religion, as well as in maners; and not we. And therefore they that haue ioined with you, whoſoeuer they haue beene, are like at the day of iudgement, to ſmart for nothing more, then for taking part with you.

And therfore is it, that we haue ſo ſeperated our ſelues from you as we haue, becauſe we find, that you are apoſtataes, &amp; long haue bene, from the ancient Catholicke Church of Chriſt, and from the truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ancient Roman Church it ſelfe; with whom we cannot growe in common, vnleſſe we had forſaken your fellowſhip. And this kinde of ſeperation of our ſelues from you, we know was more neceſſarie, and is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, then al the ſeperation, of Heremites, or any other of your caged birdes, howſoeuer you could haue allowed that, better then this, of ours.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:18269:253"/> at your hands. What? I truſt you are not ſo meane a diuine, as to thinke it alwaies beſt, for men to continue communion, with them in all things, that haue baptiſed them? You know, I am ſure, that the <hi>Arrian</hi> heretickes (their hereſie ſpreading it ſelfe, ſo broad as it did, and continuing diuers 100 yeares) and other heretiques, as well as they, baptiſed many, and yet I hope you wil not thinke, that they might not after, forſake their hereſies, to turne to the truth? You know, many did forſake them, and came to the trueth, &amp; yet, it was counted an hereſie, to baptiſe them againe. The better yet to ſhew that we ſhould not haue departed from you, you tel vs that you haue continued, without adding and diminiſhing, in that doctrine which was taught by the Apoſtles firſt, and ſince from hand to hand, in all integrity, hath bene by the ſucceſſion of faithful paſtors, conueighed downe vnto you: and ſo we had both baptiſme, and all our other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode with you. Theſe are but wordes, the euidence of the thing is to the contrary (as I haue ſufficiently made demonſtration before.) Proue this indeed, and we will repent vs of our departing from you, &amp; moſt ioifully &amp; willingly wil wee ioyne with you againe. I like very well your counſell, that euery good Chriſtian ſhould fully reſolue, and determine to ſerue God, and to liue and die in the Catholicke faith: but then I adde, that he had need well and throughlie to bee reſolued, what, and which is that true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Faith. For his direction in this behalfe, how to diſcerne, which is the right way to heauen, and which not; and conſequentlie, which is the true catholicke faith, &amp; which is not: you teach him, that when there is any queſtion put, as touching life, then the common way, as Chriſt doeth ſay, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. doeth lead to perdition, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to ſaluation: but in religion it is contrary: whereunto you ſaie, <hi>Dauid</hi> alluded <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. ſaying: <hi>ſhew me thy waies O Lorde, and teach me thy pathes:</hi> by <hi>waies,</hi> meaning religion; and by <hi>pathes,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners. Where learned you this diuinity? If you looke vpon Chriſts wordes well, you ſhall finde, that hee counted the waie to heauen, ſtraight, as well in reſpect of religion, as life: and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vſuall with <hi>Dauid,</hi> then indifferently without any ſuch nice diſtinction, to vſe theſe wordes <hi>waies,</hi> and <hi>pathes,</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of the one, and the other; you might eaſily perceiue, if you were anie thing conuerſant in his <hi>Pſalmes:</hi> looke vpon Chriſts time, whereunto he had an eſpeciall eie, when hee vſed theſe wordes, and you ſhall finde, that true religion was a thing more geyſon, and rare
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:18269:254"/> then in the worlde, and had fewer followers; then an holy and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many of the Phariſees, and Philoſophers made great ſhew of that; &amp; that therefore, to leade vs rather, to thinke that in reſpect of Religion then maners, he had vttered thoſe wordes; immediately thereupon he addeth, <hi>beware of falſe Prophets.</hi> And as for <hi>Dauid</hi> (if your argument be grounded vpon that that he placeth the word <hi>waies,</hi> in the firſt place; and <hi>pathes,</hi> in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) if you marke him well, you ſhall oftentimes finde him, to inuert that order in the Pſalmes. And Pſalme 109. becauſe you ſhould plainly ſee, that he referreth <hi>waies,</hi> as wel to maners, as to Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſaieth: <hi>take from me the way of lying, and teach me the way of thy ſtatutes.</hi> And conſidering that you cannot be ignorant, that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and Paganiſme, in Chriſts time, was more common, then Chriſts Religion, &amp; therefore had 10000. that tooke it for true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in compariſon of one, that tooke Chriſts ſo; I wonder that you euer durſt thus expound Chriſts wordes. For by your expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he tolde them, that it was better for them, to embrace paganiſme, then his Religion: for that was the common beaten way, and his was but a ſmall bie-path. Againe, in <hi>Liberius</hi> his time, when it was an hard matter, to finde one true Catholique, for an 100. <hi>Arrians:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaied vnto <hi>Liberius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he alone fauoured <hi>Athanaſius, Theodor.

You though you haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your ſelues, to bee neuer ſo ſicke in maners, and haue taught vs, that Religion muſt not be ſtained, and thought to be blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for the lewde liues of ſome, of the profeſſours; yet your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke ſo ouerflowed (it ſeemeth) with choller againſt vs, and namely againſt that reuerend father <hi>Theodore Beza;</hi> that you could not bee quiet, vntill you had caſt it vp, to eaſe your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke a little. You firſt tell vs, that by experience, and reading of the ſtories of our Martyres, you are able to ſay ſo much of our lewde liues; as that wee haue not much amended the faults that wee finde in you. And then you come to that, where you long to bee, to diſcredit <hi>Beza:</hi> to whoſe charge, you ſay ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry heinous crimes, and that vpon the report of <hi>Tilemannus Heſhuſius,</hi> a bitter and intemperate enemy of his, for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion amongſt vs, for the maner of Chriſtes preſence, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:18269:255"/> in; whatſoeuer you haue reade, or ſeene of vs, that we haue read and ſeene more monſtrous and horrible ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the liues of your moſt holy fathers, and Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> then you are able to charge all that euer profeſſed our Religion withall. Was there euer like ſauadge crueltie amongſt vs, one to another, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was amongſt them, about <hi>Formoſus?</hi> Their pride hath appeared moſt monſtrous, in treading vpon Emperours necks, and otherwiſe infinitely, in miſuſing of them; as I haue at large ſhewed Chapter ſixteenth. Their deteſtable ſorcery, nicroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and poyſoning one another, to come to the Popedome, aboue the yeare one thouſand, by <hi>Silueſter</hi> the ſecond and his followers, ſet out by <hi>Benno</hi> a Cardinall, in the life of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> is ſuch as we neuer reade the like amongſt the barbarous heathen. Their ambition to come to that place, and their inſatiable couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when they haue got it, hath paſſe, for thereby Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath beene more troubled, with Schiſmes and warres; and Chriſtian kingdomes otherwiſe, haue beene more impoueriſhed, for theſe fiue or ſixe hundreth yeares: then by all other quarrells and occaſions incident whatſoeuer. Finallie, for their filthy life, I am perſwaded, that there were few worſe, in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> then ſundry of them haue beene. For <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth; in the yeare one thouſand foure hundreth ſeuenty foure, builded ſtewe houſes of both kindes: and not long after, <hi>Paul</hi> the third, regiſtred 45000. whors, that paied him monethly ſuch a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that by the yeare it came to 40000. duckets and more. And it was no ſmall argument what filthy fruits, their forced ſingle life, both had and was likely to bring forth: that in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, in certaine fiſhpondes, there were found 6000. childrens heads. Theſe thinges your owne Croniclers, you know, doe make ſo cleare, that now euery one almoſt can name, and deſcribe them, as they haue deſerued. For mine owne part, I am euen loath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file my paper, with the names of ſuch filthy wretches, as a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them haue beene; and ſeeing the notorious euidence of the thing is ſuch, that you your ſelfe doe not here deny, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of them, haue beene lewd liuers, and therefore, therein, you haue left them without defence, it is needleſſe either to trouble my ſelfe, or my Reader, any further, with the rauing in ſuch a filthy dounghill.</p>
                  <p>To proceede therefore, you muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that you may neither
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:18269:256"/> draw argument from your writers, of the liues and deathes, of our Martyrs, nor from <hi>Heſhuſius</hi> an enemy to <hi>Beza,</hi> either againſt out Martyrs, or againſt him. For the report of an enemy you knowe, is worthily ſuſpected as partiall. And as for that which <hi>Heſhuſius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to <hi>Beza,</hi> he had it from <hi>Baudwin</hi> and <hi>Bolſacke,</hi> and other ſuch impure and filthy enemies, and <hi>Apoſtataes:</hi> who to win credit again with you, when for their miſdemeanours, our Church had caſt them of, cared not, what to write, againſt <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> though they knew it to be neuer ſo ſtarke a lie. To whom, <hi>Heſhuſius</hi> (through heat of contention, caried to a deſire, to deface his aduerſary, with whatſoeuer hee could) giuing too light credit, as the maner of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to doe but too too much in ſuch caſes, he wrote as he did. As for his Epigrams, wherewith, he chargeth him, they were made when he was but a youth of 16. or 17. years olde, publiſhed by that he was 20. then with the great liking of your ſelues. And all this was, before he was of our religion, euen whiles he was one of yours. And as he was yours, when he made them, ſo ſince he was ours, he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times himſelfe, publiſhed his harty repentance for the ſame: and that in print, as in his preface before a tragedy of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and in his preface before his poemes and epigrams, with thirty Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> reuiſed and corrected, and elſe where in his workes. And therefore for thoſe, the diſcredit is rather yours, then ours. But if he had continued in your ſide, if he had gone as farre as euer did any, not onely in writing filthie poemes, but alſo in Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitry, and whoredome it ſelfe; all had beene well inough. For of ſuch, you haue had good ſtore, and yet in good credit with you. For beſides that diuers of your Popes, as namely <hi>Clement</hi> the 8, <hi>Paul</hi> the 3, &amp; <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, were all notoriouſly infamous in the ſtories for their moſt filthie life: <hi>Iohannes Caſa</hi> your Popes Legate and an Archbiſhop in your Synagogue wrote a booke in the praiſe of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitry, printed in the yeare 1549, at <hi>Venice,</hi> which booke ſince, ſome of you, to ſhew what liking you had of it, haue newlie publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beutified with moſt execrable and filthy pictures, to ſet out that ſinne withall.

And <hi>Iſaac</hi> had an <hi>Eſau,</hi> as well as a <hi>Iacob.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:18269:259"/> the eight that were ſaued in the Arke, there was a <hi>Cham.</hi> In the foure that left <hi>Sodom,</hi> one that looked backe. And amongſt Chriſts 12. Apoſtles there was a <hi>Iudas.</hi> Yea, Chriſt hath taught vs, by the parable of the good ſeede, and tares <hi>Math.</hi> 13. that we are to expect no other in Gods owne field, but that euen vnto the harueſt there wilbe a mixture alwaies, of bad with good. But you charge vs further that amongſt vs, there are many kinde of vſuries, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; and that though one way, we care not for your images, yet we loue them ſo well an other way; that we haue robbed your churches of them. Whereunto, my anſwere is, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but there are too many amongſt vs, who by ſuch vnlawfull meanes, ſeeke to enrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; and that there are too too many profane, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, that haue our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their mouthes, who by their lewd conuerſation, diſhonour the glorious goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; we are moſt hartely ſory for it, and dayly pray vnto God, for amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof. But this we muſt tell you, that we preach againſt al ſinne &amp; impiety whatſoeuer; and namely, againſt vſury and al tumultuous and diſorderly ſpoiling of churches of ſuch thinges as you talke of. And our Religion, and the lawes in our common weale condemne and diſalow ſuch dealing, &amp; therefore we are wronged, that in theſe things, we generally, or our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al, ſhould be charged. Surely many of our vſurers &amp; extreame dealing men amongſt vs, are either men of no Religion, or yours, rather then ours: neither doe I thinke where your Religion is in greateſt credit, that in thoſe common weales, vſury lieth dead and buried. Sure I am, your Popes haue beene for a long time, the cunningeſt and vnreaſonableſt vſurers in the whole world; in that they haue ſold their palles, their lead, and other their hallowed ware, which are indeede trifles, and thinges of no valewe, for ſuch ſummes of money and gold, as they haue.</p>
                  <p>You flatly ſlaunder vs, in ſaying, <hi>that there are ſome of vs, that affirme, we are wholy without ſpot or ſinne.</hi> For we both deteſt that opinion, and count them that ſhould holde ſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen worthy to be deteſted for their ſo holding. Yet you ſay; if it were ſo, that ought not to moue you, to leaue your religion taught you by your forefathers. What a ſound ground of Religion, forefathers without diſtinction is, I haue ſhewed ſufficiently already. In which point I would alwaies haue the Chriſtian to learne, to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the olde and ancient forefathers, the Apoſtles, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in doctrine and life, in the primitiue church; and the later
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:18269:259"/> forefathers; and neuer to thinke the latter worthy following any further, then they haue followed the former, and then the danger of this dart is auoided. And that it is reaſon, we ſhould follow them no further, we may learne in that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. requireth no further to be followed then he followed Chriſt. But you haue a further reaſon, not to be moued from your Religion, for our life, were it neuer ſo Godly; becauſe Chriſt, though he was without ſin, and confirmed his doctrine, both by the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſcriptures, and <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> teſtimony: yet he ſaied, that if he had not done in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the workes and miracles, that neuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did before him; they had had no ſinne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.24. For hereof, you gather, that you may ſecurely, whatſoeuer we ſay vnto you, or howſoeuer we liue, refuſe vs and our Religion; and continue in your owne ſtill, as long as we proue not the lawfulnes of our vocation, and the goodnes of our Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion by miracles. For you know no cauſe (you ſay) why we ſhould be more priuiledged then Chriſt. This argument you vrged before <hi>cap.</hi> 30. and there I anſwered it. Where I haue ſhewed you, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt diuers other reaſons, that there was this eſpeciall reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Chriſt ſhould worke ſuch miracles as he did; to proue himſelfe the <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> becauſe expreſſely the Prophets had prophecied, that he ſo ſhould when he came: which reaſon you cannot ſhew, why now wee ſhould work miracles. For the Prophecies that were giuen forth by <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and by <hi>Iohn, Reuel.</hi> 14. of the conſumption of Antichriſt and fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhew onely, that the Lorde would doe it, by the ſpirit of his mouth, in the preaching of the euerlaſting Goſpell. That therefore is it onely, that we are to approue our ſelues by, to be the men, that the Lorde will vſe to that purpoſe. And yet herein we take not vpon vs, greater priuiledge then Chriſt. For we accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that an eſpeciall priuiledge of his, that he was ſo to confirme his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by miracles; as that, after the confirmation of it, ſo by him, &amp; his Apoſtles; and the recording of it in the new Teſtament, as it is; it ſhould thenceforth ſtand ſo firme, that it ſhould be an intollerable ſigne of incredulity; amongſt them eſpecially, that pretend they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and receaue the ſcriptures, as you would ſeeme to doe: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to require miracles more, to confirme the ſame doctrine by. You were not beſt therefore to perſwade your ſelues in this ſort, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be with your religion otherwiſe, yet you ſhalbe at the leaſt without blame, for your not receiuing of ours, becauſe we work no miracles. Deceiue not your ſelues. It is not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you now in reſpect
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:18269:260"/> of vs, and our doctrine, as it was then with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in reſpect of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his. Then, that he was the particuler perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> &amp; that therefore he being come, the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, ſhould ceaſe, and giue place to his ſacraments &amp;c: was a thing to be proued, &amp; that by miracles; becauſe it was before prophecied: whereas now thoſe things long ago, haue beene ſufficiently confirmed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we preaching vnto you no other doctrine, but that, ſo already confirmed; and requiring no further to be credited, then we can ſo proue our doctrine; eſpecially, ſeeing the prophecies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning theſe later daies, ſhew rather, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Antichriſt and his Chaplaines ſhal come, and ſeeke to preuaile by miracles, then the Lords faithful paſtours: you haue no ſuch reaſon, as they had, nor indeed any at all, to require miracles at our hands.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay vnto vs, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaied vnto the <hi>Manichees, contra epiſt.

And this being proued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you muſt yeelde with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that it is to be preferred, before all other outward thinges whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that haue kept you hitherto, in an other Religion, and church: yea, then you muſt confeſſe, notwithſtanding all your obiections o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe againſt vs, of nouelty, paucity, iars in opinion, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer elſe: yet it is your dueties to ioyne with vs, in receauing of this

Wherefore vnleſſe you will let all other bie matters go, and enter once into this queſtion with vs, in earneſt; whether your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or ours be the trueth; and for the triall thereof, will ſtand to the ſcriptures interpreted according to the ſound, and alwaies vſed rules of interpreting them; colour your refuſing thus to doe, with what colours poſſibly you can, you too too groſſely be wray the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your cauſe: and euidently ſhewe, that you onely ſeeke ſhifts, hoales, and corners, to eſcape as long as you may, the diſcredit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And your owne frends will they, nill they, ſhalbe inforced to ſee the ſame.</p>
                  <p>You conclude with prayer, that we may drawe as neare you, as we are farre from you: and that we may turne to the flock of Chriſt, the which, both to your hurt and our owne (you ſay) we haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Inſteede of Amen, to yours, I beſeech the Lord of all mercies, and father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that it would pleaſe him, of his infinit goodnes and mercy, euen for his deare ſonne Ieſus ſake; to open the eies of your mindes, and ſo to touch your hearts, as that you may haue grace, with vs, to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to leaue that gariſh whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all her abhominations, and ſo to ioyne with vs, in the true communion of Saints, and fellowſhip of the trueth, and ſpirit, that both you and we may dwell togither, as brethren, in one houſe; agree and growe togither, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body; &amp; reſt togither, as ſheepe of one flocke; vnder one father, God almighty, &amp; vnder one head, &amp; ſhepheard Chriſt Ieſus; through the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working of the holy Ghoſt, to Gods glory, and our owne euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting comfort.

This (good Chriſtian) that he hath ſaied were of fome force, if he, any, or all his fellowes togither, were euer able to proue, that they, their church, faith and Religion were ſuch, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake of, when he ſo taxed men for their departure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: but ſeeing onely moſt beggerly all the packe of them, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the maine queſtion betwixt them and vs, alwaies take this for graunted them, euen for their bolde impudent and importunate begging of it, which we will neuer graunt them nor they ſhall euer be able to winne at our hands, all that he hath ſaied herein, is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and vaine.

Againe, if they thinke that men are bound alwaies to liue and die in that Religion, whereof they were, that baptized them, why doe they labour by their Ieſuits &amp; ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſeduce to their Religion, ſuch as we haue baptized? But yet to touch them more neerely, for all this brag of their ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in the faith and Religion they firſt receaued, let euen their owne Baptiſme, and their faith and Religion that they after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, bee compared togither, and the contrary will appeare. For they being al baptized in the name onely of the Father, the Sonne &amp; the holy Ghoſt, as it is well knowen they are, thereby they are bounde onely to beleeue in this Trinity in Vnity, and Vnitie in Trinity, and yet afterwardes all the ſort of them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Apoſtles Creede, and all other ancient Creeds teach them the ſame, become plaine apoſtataes from this faith, in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in a number, both of perſons and thinges, that without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy they cannot count either God the Father, God the Sonne, or
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:18269:262"/> God the holy Ghoſt. Proofe and moſt palpable demonſtration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is their beliefe in their owne merits, merits of others, Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, halowed water &amp; other halowed things, &amp; their beliefe in, and therefore praying vnto, Saints &amp; Angels. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonderful prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God doubtles, this forme of baptiſme, &amp; theſe creeds were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; continued amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not only to make it euen thereby eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (whatſoeuer any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brag to the contrary neuer ſo oft) that they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daily depart both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of Chriſt, firſt taught them &amp; their forefathers, and after particulerly in their baptiſme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed to euery one of them: but alſo to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before both God &amp; man, without all excuſe; of their ſo groſſe apoſtacy from the ſame, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. Wheras they know, &amp; all the world els, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth vs, know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſimply continue in this faith, firſt deliuered vntd vs briefly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy catholique church in theſe creeds, &amp; daily ſealed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs in our baptiſme, &amp; that euen for that it is, that we are ſo hated, and perſecuted of them, that with them we will not run out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this church and faith, to beleeue in a 1000. things that are not God, as they doe. And therefore, theſe things conſidered, by this note they are proued to be the Antichriſtian falſe prophets, heretiques, &amp; ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, that he ſpeaketh of, and not we.</p>
            <p>His ſecond ſure marke, ſigne and token of falſe prophets &amp;c. is (ſaieth he) <hi>that they being departed from the catholique church, doe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; of their owne authority, without warrant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſent, ſet vp a new goſpell, a new faith and Religion, and ſo by preaching a newe doctrine, aſſemble and ſet vp a newe church and congregation.</hi> And to proue this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. are quoted, whence onely we may learne to this purpoſe, that none may take vpon them an office in Gods houſe, without law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full calling and warrant from him. Yet hereupon, as though theſe were moſt pregnant places to proue, that to be neceſſary to a lawefull calling, which the learned proteſtant can neuer proue to bee in our calling, he promiſeth likewiſe to yeelde, and to recant, when wee ſhall bee able to proue our iuſt and due voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ordinarily or extraordinarily, to proceede of God and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By his owne words, in deſcribing this note or marke, two things muſt concurre to the making of it, namely, the preaching of a newe Religion or Goſpell, and the doing of it without a iuſt and due vocation from God: and yet in the prouing it to be ſuch a marke, &amp; in the applying it to vs, he forgetteth altogither the former, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18269:263"/> only ſhew of proofe for the later. Belike his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience tolde him, that howſoeuer it was an eaſie matter to inſinuate, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was new, that yet he was not able ſo much as to make any ſhew, that he could proue it ſo to be indeed. And touching the other, howſoeuer the places quoted by him, ſerue to proue a lawful calling or ſending by God to be neceſſary for and to all ſuch, as ſhal take any office vpon them in his Church, yet they proue not at al, that there is any thing needful to the prouing of our vocation to be ſuch, wanting in ours, neither doeth he name any thing required in any of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be in ours, which he could ſay we wanted: which it is likely he would not haue omitted to haue done, if he had ſeene, that with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probability he might haue done it. And therefore any man may ſee, that euen in this ſigne (as in the former) his onely ground is a falſe ſuppoſition, that thoſe things muſt needs be graunted him all, which both moſt iuſtly and confidently we alwaies deny. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proofe or ſhadow of proofe, he in one periode aſſumeth three things againſt vs, moſt vntruely &amp; ſlanderouſly, (as at large in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of my anſwere to <hi>Albine</hi> I haue made it manifeſt) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that we are gone out of the true catholicke Church, that wee haue ſet vp a new faith and religion, and that we haue aſſembled a new Church and congregation</hi> Yea (chriſtian reader) if thou wouldeſt but vouchſafe, by the table annexed vnto this anſwere of mine, to turne to the places in the ſaied anſwere, where theſe points be handled, the antiquity of our church and religion, the newnes of popery, and the contrariety betwixt the Romiſh church, that now is, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, fathers and councels, in the true catholicke church of Chriſt, &amp; the lawfulnes of our calling to the miniſtry and the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of their prieſthood and vocation thereunto; &amp; vnto other prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies amongſt them, and when thou haſt found them, to read ouer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, what I haue writen hereof, I doubt not but thereby thou wouldeſt ſee, not onely, that he vniuſtly hath here charged vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe three faults, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt iuſtly we may charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. And therfore therunto referring thee for further anſwere vnto this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold charge of his in this place, vpon that which there thou ſhalt finde (I hope) with mee thou wilt conclude, that this beeing a marke and a moſt certaine ſigne of antichriſtian heretiques (as he ſaieth) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſtandeth faire vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not vpon vs, &amp; therfore he ſhould reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>The third ſigne &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the offerer talketh of, is, <hi>that ſuch, ouer and aboue the properties touched in the two former, doe preach
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:18269:263"/> and teach contentiouſly and ſeditiouſly, againſt the doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, taught of the common knowen Catholicke Church of Chriſt, as namely</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>againſt the ſacraments of Chriſts Church by a flat denial of many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, againſt the real preſence of Chriſts body in the holy euchariſt, againſt the bleſſed ſacrifice of the maſſe propitiatory both for the liue and the dead, againſt penance &amp; the worthy fruits thereof, by faſting, watching, and praier &amp; al ſtraightnes of life, againſt vowes, inuocation of Saints, praier for ſoules departed, and finally againſt the Church it ſelfe, flatly denying, that Chriſt hath here vpon earth any ſpouſe or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church to be heard ſpeak, perceiued or ſeene.</hi> The ground of which ſigne, he maketh that ſaying <hi>Hebrues</hi> 13, <hi>be you not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with diuers and ſtrange doctrines: ſo tearmed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> (as he expoundeth him) <hi>becauſe they agree not, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the receiued and common knowen doctrine of Chriſts holy catholicke Church:</hi> whereupon he groweth to his concluſion, <hi>that when the learned proteſtant ſhal be able to proue, that they and not we, are by our preaching of theſe ſtrange doctrines the raiſers vp of theſe ſtrifes and contentions, then he wil recant and not before.</hi> Whereunto I anſwere, that vnderſtanding by the common knowen catholicke Church, the true Church of Chriſt, which is knowen and acknowledged ſo to be alwaies of him and his faithfull members, then we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that this is a right marke of ſuch as he would haue it to be a marke of, and that worthely in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> all men are warned to take heed, that they be not caried away with diuers and ſtrange doctrines, from that, which ſhe hath vniuerſally taught and receiued. But ſo taking the common knowen catholicke Church of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not otherwiſe, I ſay it, and haue proued it in my anſwere to <hi>Albine,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that now is, hath too long and doeth ſtill, not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiouſly and ſeditiouſly, but alſo furiouſly, tirannically, bloude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and euery way antichriſtianly, preach againſt the doctrine before time taught by her, and commonly receaued and profeſſed by hers, touching the true vſe of the law and the goſpell, the office of Chriſt &amp; faith in him, the doctrine of faith and workes, and of praier and the ſacramentes, and almoſt of all other principall pointes of the true Chriſtian religion. And thus I am ſure hee muſt vnderſtand the church of Chriſt, if either he would haue this to be a certaine ſigne of heretiques, or to be thought rightly to haue expounded the 13. to the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:18269:264"/> 
               <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And therefore vnderſtanding by the common knowen catholique Church of Chriſt, that which he ſhould, this marke is euident vpon them, and not vpon vs. But if by the common knowen catholicke church of Chriſt, that hee talketh of here and alwaies elſe, he vnderſtand (as it is apparent that hee doeth) their Roman church that now is, moſt beggerly ſtill hee beggeth that almes, that neuer an honeſt and wiſe man in the world would giue him. For in all theſe points here named by him, that Synagogue a long time hath taught, and doeth ſtill, ſo contrary to the true and chaſt ſpouſe of Chriſt, that though nether ſeditiouſly nor contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet vehemently and earneſtly, it is the part of all ſkilfull, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and faithfull miniſters of the Lord, to cry out againſt her, and her ſo doing. And thus onely haue we and doe we, labour to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto the world their corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doctrine in theſe points, leaſt thereby to their perdition, they ſhould be ſeduced by them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whatſoeuer he ſaieth, neither he nor all his faction, ſhall euer he able to proue againſt vs, that we either deny any thing, or hold otherwiſe of any point here reckoned vp by him, then we haue moſt ſound and good warrant for, both out of the ſcriptures, and out of the ancienteſt and ſoundeſt monuments of antiquity. But where as he ſaith, that we flatly deny that Chriſt hath here vpon earth any ſpouſe, or viſible church to bee heard ſpeake, perceaued or ſeene, hee ſhamefully and vntruely reporteth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of vs. Onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or not viſibility of. Chriſts church, this wee holde and teach, that who be the right members thereof, whereof properly ſhe doeth conſiſt, it is not diſcerneable by humane ſence, but knowen onely vnto God, and vnto thoſe to whom God giueth ſpirituall ſences to diſcerne it withall: but if otherwiſe by the church of Chriſt here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, be vnderſtoode generally all thoſe that by outwarde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſeeme vnto men to be thereof, then we hold and confeſſe, that Chriſt hath alwaies had here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, ſince the beginning, and wil haue to the ende, a viſible ſpouſe and church to be both heard ſpeake, perceiued &amp; ſeene, though not alwaies alike, nor of al ſorts &amp; kinde of men, as I haue ſhewed at large in the firſt and fourth chapters of my anſwere to <hi>Albine.</hi> The onely thing that we deny is, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath beene, and euer muſt be ſo viſible and apparent, both for multitude and gouernment, that euery one ſhould be able ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only to diſcerne it, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt to the ende of the world, to name the principall perſons, by whoſe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18269:264"/> orderly ſucceſſion one to another w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out interruption, it hath bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in one place or other. Now hereupon to infer, that wee ſimply deny it to be heard, ſeene or perceiued, argueth, that they that doe ſo, are growen ſo groſſe, that they can neither heare, ſee nor perceiue, that there is any difference betwixt the maner of being of a thing; &amp; the ſimple being therof. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that neuer taught that the Church of Chriſt here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth ſhould neither be heard, ſeen or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, yet teacheth <hi>Re.</hi> 12. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe would be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by perſecution of the drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, into the wildernes, where for a time, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon that ſhe was before, ſhe ſhould be hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath taught vs, that hel gates ſhal neuer preuaile againſt his church <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. yet foreſheweth, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, true faith ſhould hardly be found vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth <hi>Luke</hi> 18. And doe we not read 2 <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> 2. and 1. <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. to that end, that before that day, there ſhall be a great departing from the faith, which by that which we read <hi>Reuelations</hi> 17 and 18. we may vnderſtand ſhal be ſo great and ſo farre preuaile, that the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there figuring vnto vs Antichriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhall haue vniuerſality and all outward pompe that may be, ſo on her ſide, that ſhee ſhall make kings and people, yea all nations, drunke with the wine of her fornications. During the fulfilling of which propheſies, if it bee hard for ſome, either to heare or ſee the Church, or to vnderſtand where ſhee is, ſo that they cannot name the perſons ſucceſſiuely, that ſhe conſiſteth of, no maruell. For diſtance of time and place, and ignorance, or vnfaithfulneſſe in Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers, ioyned with a ſpeciall care, that Antichriſt would alwaies, by all likelyhoode haue, to keepe from men, all meanes to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue knowledge of theſe things, leaſt therby in the end he ſhould fall into his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumption; in reſpect of ſundry former times and vs that liue now, might make this impoſſible. And yet he that ſhould ſay ſo, doeth not ſimply ſay, as he here chargeth vs. But Gods name be bleſſed for it, the Church yet, was neuer ſo driuen into the wilderneſſe by the dragon, or oppreſſed by Antichriſt, but as I haue ſhewed in my fourth Chapter of my foreſaied anſwere to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,</hi> ſome haue ſo heard, ſeene and perceiued where ſhe was, and who were her true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers at al times, that there was neuer time or ſtate of the Church ſo bad, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are able to na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſome of her fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and where they liued or died in the profeſſion of her trueth againſt antichriſtian abhominations. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other points here reckoned vp by him (ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle reader) though he would make thee beleeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:18269:265"/> are ſuch, as in euery point (as they teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now) haue alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene taught of the true Catholicke church of Chriſt, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo: as in great part I haue ſhewed in anſwering of <hi>Albine,</hi> &amp; as others thorowly &amp; vniuerſally haue ſhewed of them all, in ſeueral bookes writen againſt them, for their Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine therein. Howbeit leaſt by his words, in the meane time whiles thou getteſt leaſure, to peruſe what we haue writen, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning theſe points, thou ſhouldeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue worſe of our doctrine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any ſhew we deſerue: vnderſtand, that we preach againſt none of Chriſts ſacraments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we deny any ſacrament of his, in that ſence to be a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he appointed it, neither doe we deny Chriſts reall, true &amp; moſt certain preſence in the euchariſt, to the ſoule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right receiuer, onely a groſſe preſence of his body, to the mouth of euery receauer, fancied by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary both to ſcripture &amp; the nature of a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; of Chriſt himſelfe, is the preſence that there we deny. Indeed we as zealouſly as we can, preach againſt their maſſe, denying it to be any propitiatory ſacrifice, either for quicke or dead, much leſſe for both, becauſe we haue learned out of the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate of his father, as the fit Prieſt of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his owne perſon once for all, to offer propitiatory ſacrifice for the redemption of mankind, &amp; that we learne by the words of the inſtitution of this ſacrament, that it was neuer inſtituted, to repeate that, but with faith and thankeſgiuing to make a commemoration thereof, and rather to offer and deliuer Chriſt to vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offer him againe to his father. If by penance, he vnderſtand repentance, we neither preach againſt it nor againſt any worthy fruit thereof. For we moſt earneſtly call for both, but if by penance, be vnderſtood, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voluntary or enioyned penance (as they commonly take it) ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an opinion, thereby either to ſatiſfie for ſinnes paſt, or to merit at Gods hand, becauſe we know, that ſuch penance, and all the fruits thereof are abhominable before God, becauſe thereby Chriſt is robbed of that honour of a ful and perfect ſauiour, in &amp; by himſelfe alone, that is due vnto him, then we graunt (as we haue iuſt cauſe) we preach againſt it. Otherwiſe, faſting, ſtraightnes of life, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and lawfull vowes, to make vs more ready &amp; feruent in holy prayer, we commend and vrge. Indeed praying to Saints, becauſe we haue neither example, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, nor promiſe in Gods book to encourage vs thereunto, but all to the contrary, we condemne as groſſe idolatry: and likewiſe prayer for ſoules departed, as they vſe
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:18269:265"/> it, to relieue foules in purgatory, for the ſame reaſons, and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we preach againſt. But what we teach of theſe two points, and what not, and what reaſons we haue for our ſo doing, and how quite voide they be of all ground for theirs, I refer thee to the 37 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my anſwere to <hi>Albine,</hi> where I haue at large, ſhewed theſe things. And thus much therfore for this 3 ſigne.</p>
            <p>The next is, <hi>to bring a ſchiſme into the Church, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Pauls exhortation</hi> 1. <hi>Cor,</hi> 1. <hi>and that ſuch a ſchiſme, as wherby, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one member ſhall be ſeperated from an other, but the whole myſtical body from the true head Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> which we to haue done, in ſeperating our ſelues from their Church, &amp; not they, hee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and ſo concludeth when the learned proteſtant can ſhew the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary, that he wil recant and not before. Still thus thou maieſt ſee (good reader) that this man is no changling. For vnles that be gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted him, which is the maine point betwixt vs, that their Church is the true Church of Chriſt, &amp; their doctrine the ſound catholicke faith and religion, he hath no ground or foundation, for any thing he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For he cannot be ſo ignorant as to imagine, that euery one ſtraight is authour of ſuch a ſchiſme, as he here ſpeaketh of, that by doctrine draweth others from euery ſociety or company, inueſting themſelues with the name of the Church, and bragging that they haue the trueth. For what would he then make of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who in their time drew ſo many after them from holding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And therefore in it, that in the deepe policy of Sathan, to blunt the edge of the law, that it haue not this force to breake and make contrite the heart of man, with the ougly ſight of his owne infinite ſinnes and puniſhments due vnto him for the ſame, to driue him to hunger, and thirſt after that effectuall iuſtification and ſaluation, offered vnto men by the goſpell in Chriſt, they teach that man hath free-will to good, that concupiſcence or the firſt motions to ſinne, riſing in man not conſented vnto, are no ſinne, that many ſinnes, euen for their owne littlenes, are ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iall, that by good deedes man may ſatiſfied God for his miſdeedes, that man may fulfill the law, yea that man may haue workes of ſupererogation, more then hee needes for his owne ſaluation, and that men by their workes maie merit a great part of their owne ſaluation, yea haue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits both before iuſtification, flowing from their pure natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and powers, to prouoke GOD to thinke it <hi>congruum,</hi> that is, meete and conuenient, that euen therefore hee ſhould
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:18269:267"/> beſtow his grace vpon them, and after merits <hi>de condigno,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their very worthines, deſerue an euerlaſting reward of bliſſe at Gods hand, both for themſelues and others. And when they would ſeeme to be come vnto Chriſt and to beleeue in him, yet in no caſe, wil they truſt to him alone, and that that hee hath done and ſtill doeth for them, but then his ſufferinges and their owne, his merits and their owne, and their frendes, his ſacrifice and their owne in their maſſe, his mediation and the mediation of Saints and angels, and an hundreth things els, euen childiſh and rediculous, for the matter of ſaluation, muſt be truſted vnto. That it is thus, all the world ſeeth, and they themſelues in printed bookes ſtand vpon it, that it muſt be thus, and that we are heretiques, becauſe we will not let them alone, in thus apparelling themſelues, their frends, and their toies, with the ſpoiles of our Chriſt, and ſo their very glory, is their ſhame. A Chriſt that is ſo baſe minded, in the office of iuſtifying and ſauing of mens ſoules, thus to be iumbled and ioined, with ſo many partners and helpers, is a Chriſt of their owne deuiſing, ſuch an one doubtles, as we can heare no news of, either in old or new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And therefore out of all queſtion, they ſhall finde, that whiles they run a madding after this fanſied new Chriſt of their owne, the old true Chriſt will profit them nothing at all, and that they are quite fallen from grace. No man whoſe eies God hath opened aright, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vnderſtand the law or the goſpel, but ſeeing and knowing theſe things to be true of them, he muſt needs thinke and bee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that popery is euen that myſtery of iniquity, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and that the papiſts be flat, thoſe flaſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of 2. Epiſtle chap. 3. <hi>Which priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould bring in damnable hereſies, euen denying the Lorde that hath bought them, and ſo bring vpon themſelues ſwift dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whom yet many ſhould follow, and by whom the way of trueth ſhould bee euill ſpoken of &amp;c.</hi> It is needfull therefore, I would thinke, eſpecialy conſidering, how earneſt Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is there to perſwade men to ſhun ſuch, for vs to leaue them and forſake them, as we haue: the thing which in this behalfe we haue eſpecially to mourne for, is, that we forſooke them no ſooner.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, though the better to countenance their Church and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to proue vs in thus forſaking of them, to haue brought in ſuch a ſchiſm, as he talketh of, he would make thee (chriſtian reader) beleeue, that all the world were at vnity with them in their faith &amp;
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:18269:267"/> and falſe bragge, as if thou readeſt the fourth chapter of my anſwere to <hi>Albine,</hi> and the 11. &amp; 37. thou ſhalt moſt plainely ſee. It ſeemeth the man was very impudent, or very childiſhly ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hiſtories, that would thus write. For who of any learning or reading is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that not onely the Greeke church and other Eaſterne Churches, ſome hundreth yeares before the time that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, brake of communion with them, but that alſo, euen here in theſe Weſterne parts, in <hi>France, Bohemia,</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> and elſwher, long before this time, <hi>Petrus Valdus, Iohn Wickliffe, Iohn Hus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prage,</hi> had ſo many followers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, againſt them and their abhominations, that for all the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and moſt ſauage perſecutions, that they haue vſed to roote them out by, from time to time, that yet notwithſtanding, they haue continued, doe &amp; will ſtil, in one place or other, maugre all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, euen to recompence that whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhee hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at their hands? As for the variety of opinions amongſt vs, that he vpbraydeth vs withall, it is an obiection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn de Albine</hi> often harped vpon, &amp; therefore which in anſwering of him, I haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently (I hope) anſwered. Only this therfore to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I further ſay here, that though they be more and greater then we like of, yet they are nether ſo great nor many, as theſe our aduerſaries, by amplifying of this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by multiplying of names, would ſeeme to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet in ſuch points, but that notwithſtanding, we all agree in the fundamentall &amp; moſt principal points of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, whereby, we hope, it will thorow Gods goodnes come to paſſe, that we ſhall ſhortly alſo, grow to vnity in the reſt. In the meane time ſure I am, that they whom by any reaſon he may ſay be of vs, for our holding felowſhip and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion togither in our confeſſion of the chriſtian faith, are all amongſt our ſelues, at farre more vnity then ſuch as he liketh of, &amp; at far better vnity, then they be or euer haue beene, ſince they departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. As for the Anabaptiſts &amp; diuers others whom ſometime they charge vs, in this caſe alſo withall, they know wel enough, we defy &amp; deteſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their frantick opinions, as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of all men we haue beene the forwardeſt, in writing againſt them. And therefore they doe vs the more wrong, when at any time, they aggrauate this obiection againſt vs, by charging vs to haue ſuch amongſt vs, whom thus we ſhunne and miſlike aſwell as they. Thus much therfore, let ſuffice for anſwere to this fourth ſigne, and now let vs proceede to the next.</p>

It ſeemeth the man in alleadging this text, did truſt his memory too much, for twiſe he hath writen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres</hi> for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But here againe, according to his old woont, he muſt haue it freely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and granted him, for he bringeth nothing at all to proue it, that their Biſhops and Prelates are all ſuch, as <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in teaching only Gods people the truth. For vnles this be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, it neither may be granted him, that he rightly applieth his text, nor this ſigne againſt vs. But he knoweth well enough, and ſo doe all the packe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we are ſo far from being ſo prodigall in our gifts vnto them, that we hold their prelates, biſhops &amp; Prieſts, to be very <hi>Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iambres</hi> in reſiſting our Biſhops and miniſters, in teaching the ſame truth, that they haue learned of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> and that therefore we thinke no better of them, then of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mindes &amp; reprobate in the faith. For which cauſe we are ſure, we both may and ought to diſobey them, and reſiſt them, as we doe. For ſo we finde, that <hi>Eſay, Hieremy, Amos, Michaiah,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in their times, refuſed to obey, and reſiſted the falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of the falſe Prophets, and high Prieſts, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were. What a vanity is it therefore, in this man to trouble his reader, with ſuch colde and poore ſtuffe as this is.</p>
            <p>And truely hee hath no better happe in the laſt, then in any of the former. For ſetting it downe, <hi>that fickleneſſe and ſlipperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of errours and hereſies, is a ſigne and ſure token to bewray the authors thereof, and that the catholique faith or trueth, is likewiſe to be knowen, by the conſtant ſtability thereof,</hi> he ſaieth that which we grant to be very true, as willingly as he, or any of his ſide. Inſomuch that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it is one of the principall reaſons, that we vſe to proue their opinions, that we ſtriue againſt them for, to be errours or hereſies, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for now holding them ſo obſtinatly, as they doe, heretiques, for that we are able to ſhew, how by ſtealing and ſoft paces, ſtily they began firſt to creepe in, and ſo went on fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe to worſe, vntill (to vſe his owne tearme) they came <hi>ad proſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Chapter of my anſwere to <hi>Albine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhall finde, that in a good ſort of their opinions, I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this. But to proue this, that it is the property of heretiques to be fickle and mouing, and ſo ſoone to periſh &amp; paſſe away, he alleadgeth <hi>S. Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that lying maſters doe bring vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſwift da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, &amp; their deſtruction ſleepeth not:</hi> which he ſpake of gods iudgements y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vndoubtedly ſhould ouertake ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not as he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth him, to ſhew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their opinions alwaies ſhould ſoone paſſe away and vaniſh. In the former ſence it is alwaies fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d true, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> writeth, either here, or els where, or both: but take it in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſence, then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall often be found to haue prophecied of ſuch, vntruly. For who knoweth not, that the groſſe errours of Turciſm are of very long continuance, &amp; that the errour of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> for circumciſion is far more ancients, and that yet it continueth? And muſt not of neceſſity the errours and hereſies of Antichriſt be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long continuance, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> (as we haue heard) confeſſeth, that the myſtery of that iniquity beganne to worken in his time, aboue 1500. years ago, and that it ſhould not quite be aboliſhed, before Chriſts ſecond comming, who then ſhould yet by the brightneſſe of his comming aboliſh it 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2? The trueth of whoſe prophecy in that place, is the very true ground of the antiquity, vniuerſality, and continuance of the popiſh and Antichriſtian Religion. So that howſoeuer it hath fallen out in ſome hereſies, that they haue in Gods moſt wiſe prouidence, euen quickely brought themſelues to an ende, by their ficklenes &amp; moouing, yet it appeareth, in that place the ſinne of not beleeuing the trueth, ſo notably taught and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in the iuſt iudgement of God, by Antichriſtianity is ſo ſeuerely to be puniſhed, that therewith, euen from the Apoſtles daies to the ende of the worlde, they that commit that ſinne, ſhall bee in danger to bee deluded and ſeduced moſt dangerouſly. Which I ſay, and ſure I am I can proue it, hath beene and yet is, moſt notoriouſly verifyed by popery, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull hurt and deſtruction of ſoules. Howbeit this man would faine apply this ſigne vnto vs, for that amongſt vs (as it pleaſeth him to write) here in <hi>England,</hi> for the loue we beare to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Zwinglians, Oecolampadians</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their iuſt ouerthrow, and for that now here, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians and Puritans (as he ſaith) through the affection of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:18269:269"/> people, and ſo winking at them, by ſome mageſtrates, haue brought the <hi>Zwinglians</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> to be ready to yeeld vp the ghoſt, and to tilt vp their heeles. But theſe are but vaine words, and proue not his purpoſe. For all theſe, howſoeuer in other matters of leſſer moment they too much diſagree, yet as I haue ſaied before, and as it is notoriouſly knowen, for the principall articles of religion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith or maners, they are in conſtant vnity, holding the ſame all of them, that they haue learned in theſe points out of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſcriptures, as the harmony of their confeſſions extant to the world in print, make it euident.</p>
            <p>As for the ſeuerall and priuate opinions of <hi>Luther,</hi> and his too earneſt followers, which we now miſlike, we haue likewiſe alwaies miſliked, and therefore in that reſpect they haue no other ouerthrow amongſt vs, then they alwaies ſince we firſt heard of them haue had, and howſoeuer in theſe points, we rather prefer <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins</hi> iudgement then theirs, yet certaine it is, that we build not our faith of them; nor of them, or by them, delight we to be called; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and profeſſe our ſelues to be chriſtians, and of him onely and of his vndoubted ſpirit, ſpeaking vnto vs in the canonicall ſcriptures haue we learned our religion, with which, as far as we finde any man to agree, we reuerence him, as it becommeth vs in the Lord, &amp; further we take not our ſelues bound to follow any man, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be. That Puritans and Preciſians, haue brought the ancient Proteſtants of this land of all ſortes to any ſuch point, by any ſuch meanes as he ſpeaketh of, he ſpeaketh both vntruely and ſlanderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For ſuch, as for their prepoſterous zeale and factious turbulent ſpirits, amongſt vs deſerue ſo to be called and accounted, neither are for number ſo many, nor for credit ſo affected of the common people, nor wincked at of the mageſtrats, as he pretendeth. But if ther were as many fond ſectaries that haue ariſen vp amongſt vs theſe late yeares, as this man and other of his fellowes ſometime would haue men to beleeue, as long yet, as we for all that, continue conſtant not onely in the very ſame religion that we were of, when we firſt broke of from them, but alſo in that which hath plentifull and moſt playne warrant both from the canonicall ſcriptures and al ſound antiquity, as we haue a thouſand times ſhewed, and yet ſtill are willing and ready alwaies to doe, why ſhould they thus odiouſly be obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, to diſgrace either vs, or our religion, eſpecially ſeeing wee are ſory for it, and ſhew our miſlike thereof as wee doe? May any
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:18269:269"/> man iuſtly diſgrace the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtolique churches, for that euen in their times, there aroſe ſo many ſectaries and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, amongſt the Churches planted by them, as both by their owne writings and other Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories it is notoriouſly knowen there did? Hath not Chriſt euen of purpoſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all offence taking hereat, compared his kingdome <hi>Matth. 13.</hi> to a field wherein the good ſeedſ-man hauing ſowen good wheat, the enuious man ſo ſoweth his tares, that they come vp togither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wheat, and ſo will doe vnto the harueſt? To let vaine words and brags go, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue but once any of them, or all of them togither, either that their religion is the plaine way of ſaluation, beaten by our forefathers for theſe <hi>1500.</hi> yeares paſt, or that ours is not that very trueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, as a perpetual trueth, for the true church conſtantly to hold to the worlds end, and we will ſtriue with them no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. But as this is a matter too hard &amp; heauy for them, ſo they are content to let it alone, and with fallacies &amp; vaine words, to trie if they can beguile the ſimple people, and bring them to a miſliking of that, which to miſlike indeede they are not able to giue them one ſound reaſon. And therefore to conclude, that both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ending, and alwaies, this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be like himſelfe, he taketh it for graunted, that their religion is the ſound catholique faith, that the martyr <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> meant by his loafe, which broken and broken againe, after it was once well made and baked, by ſectaries &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques (as he told <hi>Genſerichus</hi> the tyrant) would neuer become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that ours is but a breaking of it, to make it better againe, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> will neuer be. Whereas we conſtantly hold &amp; affirme, that we may iuſtly ſay to all papiſts, euen as <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſaied to that tyrant. For the loafe that we feed on, and would haue all others to feed on, with vs, we are able to proue is that, the graine whereof Chriſt himſelfe, by his faithfull ſeruants, hath ſowen in the ſound field of the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcriptures, &amp; which he himſelfe hath ground, kneaden, &amp; baked for vs and for all his children. And likewiſe we are able to proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this fine white loafe of the Lords own preparing, alwaies lying ready in the ſtorehouſe of his writen word, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh church hath a long time &amp; doth ſtil as much loath, as euer the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>Manna.</hi> And therefore as they preferred in their conceits, garlicke, leekes, &amp; onions, &amp; the fleſh-pots of Egypt, before that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly food, ſo hath ſhe and doeth ſhe a maſſiue loafe, the corne whereof muſt not come onely out of the foreſaied field of the Lord, for then it would haue no
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:18269:270"/> fauour with them, but in great part, out of the rotten field of mens traditions &amp; inuentions, before the pure white loafe of the lords own making. Wherefore to conclude, all his ſpeech or exhortation, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon this ſtory out of <hi>Victor de perſecutione Vandalorum,</hi> any man may ſee, we might farre more iuſtly, vſe againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the Romiſh Church, to perſuade them as they regard their owne ſaluation, &amp;c. to content themſelues with vs, with this <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> loafe, of the firſt and beſt making.</p>
            <p>I haue thus, thou ſeeſt (good reader) but briefly paſt ouer theſe things: and the rather I haue ſo done, firſt, becauſe I found no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them, but grounded vpon ſhameles begging of that which is moſt in queſtion: and ſecondly, becauſe in my anſwere to <hi>Albine,</hi> I had vpon occaſion giuen me by him, already anſwered al, or moſt of his aſſumptions againſt vs, in the applying of theſe ſignes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. But laſtly, by view of an anſwere made at large, by maſter <hi>Crowley,</hi> both to the <hi>22.</hi> demaunds and theſe ſix ſignes alſo, that came to my hands ſince my finiſhing of this anſwere of mine, I ſee, if it had beene vndone, I might well haue ſpared al my labour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
